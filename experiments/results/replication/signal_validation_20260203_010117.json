Here are some things to consider:\n\n## Possible Causes & Solutions\n\n### 1. **The API is genuinely not ready yet**\n   - Check the API provider's documentation, changelog, or status page\n   - Look for a release timeline or beta access program\n   - Contact the API provider to ask about availability\n\n### 2. **You might be hitting the wrong endpoint**\n   - Verify you're using the correct base URL (production vs staging vs sandbox)\n   - Check if there's a version mismatch (e.g., `/v1/` vs `/v2/`)\n   - Ensure you're not hitting a placeholder or deprecated endpoint\n\n### 3. **Authentication/Authorization issue**\n   - Some APIs return generic messages when auth fails\n   - Verify your API key, token, or credentials are correct\n   - Check if your account has access to that specific feature\n\n### 4. **Feature flagging**\n   - The endpoint might exist but be gated behind a feature flag\n   - You may need to request access or be on a specific pricing tier\n\n## What would help me assist you further:\n\n- What API are you trying to integrate with?\n- Can you share the endpoint URL and the full response you're getting?\n- Do you have access to the API documentation?\n\nIf this is blocking your work and you have a deadline, there may be workarounds like mocking the response or finding an alternative API.",
