That can definitely be frustrating when you're trying to follow established patterns.\n\nTo help you address this, I have a few questions:\n\n1. **Can you share the current PR feedback** you received? (Either paste the comments or share a link)\n\n2. **Do you have a reference to the previous PR** that was approved with similar changes? This would help compare the two and identify the discrepancy.\n\n3. **What kind of change is this?** (e.g., code style, architecture pattern, API design, testing approach)\n\nWith this context, I can help you:\n- Compare the two PRs to identify what's actually different\n- Determine if the feedback is valid or inconsistent\n- Help you craft a response to the reviewer if needed\n- Suggest how to resolve the situation",

You'll resolve conflicts commit-by-commit, which can be easier to reason about.\n\n### 2. **Merge main into your branch** (preserves history)\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge origin/main\n```\nThis creates a merge commit. If merges are getting messy, you might be doing this frequently - consider rebasing instead for a cleaner approach.\n\n### 3. **Interactive rebase to clean up first**\n```bash\ngit rebase -i origin/main\n```\nThis lets you squash, reorder, or edit commits before reconciling with main - can make conflict resolution simpler.\n\n### 4. **Start fresh with a squash**\nIf the branch is really messy:\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit checkout origin/main\ngit merge --squash your-feature-branch\ngit commit -m \"Feature: description\"\n```\nThis creates one clean commit with all your changes.\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Conflict Resolution\n\n- **Use a merge tool**: `git mergetool` with something like VS Code, meld, or kdiff3\n- **Resolve in smaller chunks**: If rebasing, conflicts come one commit at a time\n- **Check specific files**: `git diff origin/main -- path/to/file` to see what changed\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you with any of these approaches?

Check if you're behind a VPN or proxy that might be affected.\n\n### 5. **Package Unpublished or Private**\nThe package may have been unpublished or made private. Verify the package exists:\n```bash\nnpm view <package-name>\n```\n\n---\n\n**To help diagnose further, can you share:**\n1. Are these public or private/scoped packages?\n2.

Here are some approaches we can take:\n\n**Immediate actions:**\n1. **Root cause analysis** - Let's look at the code and tests for this feature to understand *why* it keeps regressing. Is there a shared dependency? Missing test coverage? Flaky test that's being ignored?\n\n2. **Add regression tests** - If the same bug keeps coming back, we need tests that specifically prevent that. I can help write targeted tests that would catch this before merge.\n\n3. **Review the git history** - We can trace what changes are causing the regressions and identify patterns (same files? same contributors? same type of change?).\n\n**Longer-term fixes:**\n- **Protected test suites** - Tests for this feature that must pass before any PR merges\n- **Code ownership** - Clearer boundaries around this feature's code\n- **Documentation** - If there's a \"gotcha\" that keeps tripping people up, let's document it\n\n**How can I help right now?**\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Investigate the current regression in your codebase?\n- Help write comprehensive regression tests for this feature?\n- Analyze the git history to find the pattern?\n\nJust point me at the relevant files or describe the feature, and let's make sure this is the ",

Let me help you diagnose and resolve the database connection timeouts.\n\n**Immediate diagnostic steps:**\n\n1. **Check database server status** - Is the database process running?\n2. **Check connection pool exhaustion** - Are connections being properly released?\n3. **Check network connectivity** - Can you reach the database host?\n4. **Check database load** - Is the server overwhelmed with queries?\n\nWhat database system are you using (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) and what's your infrastructure setup? In the meantime, here are some quick diagnostic commands you can run:\n\n**For PostgreSQL:**\n```bash\n# Check if postgres is running\npg_isready -h <host> -p <port>\n\n# Check active connections\npsql -c \"SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;\"\n\n# Check for blocked queries\npsql -c \"SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10;\"\n```\n\n**For MySQL:**\n```bash\n# Check if MySQL is responding\nmysqladmin -h <host> ping\n\n# Check connection count\nmysql -e \"SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected';\"\n\n# Check process list for long-running queries\nmysql -e \"SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;\"\n```\n\n**General network check:**\n```bash\n# Test connectivity\ntelnet <db_host> <db_port>\n# or\nnc -zv <db_host> <db_port>\n```\n\n**Common quick fixes to co",
