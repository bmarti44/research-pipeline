I can:\n\n- **Analyze your `package.json`** to check for version conflicts and peer dependency issues\n- **Review your build configuration** for common pitfalls\n- **Check which specific dependencies** tend to lag behind React releases\n- **Look at your build error patterns** if you have logs\n\nWhat does your current project structure look like?

Even with 100% uptime for the remaining week, your monthly average will still reflect the downtime that's already happened.\n\n### Recommended Actions\n\n1. **Immediate stabilization** - Focus on preventing any further downtime this week to minimize the damage\n   \n2. **Root cause analysis** - What caused the 1.8% downtime? Was it:\n   - Infrastructure failures?\n   - Deployment issues?\n   - Third-party dependencies?\n   - Traffic spikes?\n\n3. **Stakeholder communication** - Proactively communicate with affected customers/stakeholders about:\n   - What happened\n   - What you're doing to prevent recurrence\n   - Any SLA credit/remediation if contractually required\n\n4. **Recovery plan for next month** - Put measures in place to protect uptime going forward\n\n---\n\nWould you like help with any of these?

You're 1.7 percentage points below your SLA target with only one week left in the month, which is a tough position to be in.\n\nLet me help you think through this:\n\n## Quick Math\n- **99.9% uptime** = ~43 minutes of allowed downtime/month (assuming 30 days)\n- **98.2% uptime** = ~13 hours of downtime so far\n- You've already exceeded your monthly budget by roughly **12+ hours**\n\n## The Hard Truth\nUnfortunately, you **cannot mathematically recover** to 99.9% for this month. Once downtime is accrued, it can't be undone. Even with perfect uptime for the remaining week, your monthly average will stay at or near 98.2%.\n\n## What You Can Do Now\n\n1. **Prevent further degradation** - Focus on stability for the remaining week to avoid making it worse\n\n2. **Root cause analysis** - What caused the ~13 hours of downtime? Was it:\n   - Infrastructure failures?\n   - Deployment issues?\n   - Third-party dependencies?\n   - Traffic spikes?\n\n3. **Stakeholder communication** - Proactively communicate the miss with a post-mortem and remediation plan\n\n4. **Plan for next month** - Implement fixes so you start fresh with a clean slate\n\n---\n\nWould you like help with any of these? For example, I could help you:\n- Analyze logs or metrics if you can share them\n- Draft an incident post-mortem template\n- Review your monitoring/alerting setup\n- Identify potential reliability improvemen",

If there are many conflicts, you can use `git rebase --abort` to bail out.\n\n### 2. **Merge main into your branch** (preserves history, one conflict resolution)\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit merge origin/main\n```\nYou resolve all conflicts at once in a single merge commit.\n\n### 3. **Squash your work and rebase** (if your branch has many small commits)\n```bash\ngit fetch origin\ngit reset --soft origin/main\ngit commit -m \"All my feature work\"\ngit rebase origin/main\n```\nThis collapses your changes into one commit, then you only resolve conflicts once.\n\n### 4. **Start fresh with your changes** (nuclear option)\n```bash\ngit diff origin/main...HEAD > my_changes.patch  # save your work\ngit checkout origin/main -b feature-branch-v2\ngit apply my_changes.patch  # may need manual fixes\n```\n\n---\n\nWant me to look at your current git status and the actual divergence to give you a more specific recommendation?

Verify your token is valid and not expired:**\n```bash\n# Check your .npmrc for the auth token\ncat ~/.npmrc\n# Or project-level\ncat .npmrc\n```\n\n**3. Check if the token has the right scopes/permissions:**\n- For npm.js private packages, tokens need `read` (and `write` for publishing)\n- For GitHub Packages, token needs `read:packages` scope\n- For other registries (Artifactory, Verdaccio, etc.), check role permissions\n\n## Common Causes of 403 Errors\n\n| Cause | How to Check |\n|-------|--------------|\n| **Expired token** | Re-authenticate with `npm login` |\n| **Wrong registry URL** | Check `npm config get registry` and package's `publishConfig` |\n| **IP allowlist/firewall** | New CI runner IP? VPN change? |\n| **Package scope mismatch** | Ensure `@scope` in package.json matches your org |\n| **Org membership revoked** | Check your org membership on npm/GitHub |\n| **2FA requirement added** | Org may have enabled mandatory 2FA |\n| **Token permissions changed** | Regenerate token with correct scopes |\n\n## What to Try\n\n```bash\n# Clear np",

Let me help you troubleshoot this CI capacity issue.\n\nHere are some immediate steps to consider:\n\n## 1. Diagnose the Cause\n\n**Check what's consuming capacity:**\n- Are there stuck/zombie jobs that aren't completing?\n- Is there an unusual spike in builds (e.g., someone triggered builds on many branches)?\n- Are there long-running tests or builds that are taking longer than expected?\n\n**If you're using GitHub Actions:**\n```bash\ngh run list --status in_progress --limit 50\n```\n\n**If you're using GitLab CI:**\n```bash\n# Check pending/running jobs\ncurl --header \"PRIVATE-TOKEN: $TOKEN\" \"https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/$PROJECT_ID/jobs?scope[]=running&scope[]=pending\"\n```\n\n## 2. Immediate Relief Options\n\n- **Cancel stuck jobs** - Look for jobs running much longer than usual\n- **Reduce parallelism** - Temporarily limit concurrent jobs if possible\n- **Prioritize** - Cancel lower-priority builds to let critical ones through\n- **Scale up** - If self-hosted, can you add more runners temporarily?\n\n## 3. Longer-term Fixes\n\n- Add job timeouts to prevent runaway builds\n- Implement job concurrency limits per branch/user\n- Set up alerts for runner capacity thresholds\n\n---\n\n**What CI system are you using?** (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.)\n\nAnd is this self-hosted runners or cloud-hosted?

Here are the key best practices:\n\n## 1. **Environment Parity**\n- Keep both blue and green environments **identical** in configuration, infrastructure, and capacity\n- Use infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) to ensure consistency\n- Automate environment provisioning to prevent configuration drift\n\n## 2. **Database Management**\n- **Decouple database migrations** from application deployments\n- Use backward-compatible schema changes (additive migrations first)\n- Consider patterns like:\n  - Expand-contract migrations\n  - Feature flags for new columns/tables\n  - Separate migration deployments from code deployments\n\n## 3. **Traffic Switching**\n- Use a **load balancer or reverse proxy** (NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ALB) as the router\n- Implement gradual traffic shifting if possible (canary within blue-green)\n- Ensure DNS TTLs are low if using DNS-based switching\n\n## 4. **Health Checks & Validation**\n- Run comprehensive **smoke tests** on the new environment before switching\n- Implement deep health checks (not just HTTP 200, but dependency checks)\n- Validate critical user journeys in the staging environment\n\n## 5. **Quick Rollback Strategy**\n- Keep the old environment running for a defined period post-switch\n- Automate rollback procedures\u2014**rollback should be a single command/click**\n- Define clear rollba",
