Here are the best practices across different dimensions:\n\n## 1. **Use Structured Error Handling**\n\n```javascript\n// JavaScript/TypeScript\ntry {\n  await riskyOperation();\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {\n    // Handle specific error type\n  } else {\n    // Handle unexpected errors\n    throw error; // Re-throw if you can't handle it\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```python\n# Python\ntry:\n    risky_operation()\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    # Handle specific exception\n    logger.warning(f\"Validation failed: {e}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Handle unexpected errors\n    logger.error(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n    raise\n```\n\n## 2. **Fail Fast, Fail Loudly**\n- Validate inputs early before doing work\n- Don't silently swallow errors\n- Let errors propagate if you can't meaningfully handle them\n\n## 3. **Use Custom Error Types**\n```python\nclass UserNotFoundError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, user_id):\n        self.user_id = user_id\n        super().__init__(f\"User {user_id} not found\")\n```\n\nThis makes errors more informative and easier to catch specifically.\n\n## 4. **Return Result Types (Functional Approach)**\n```rust\n// Rust-style Result type\nfn divide(a: f64, b: f64) -> Result<f64, DivisionError> {\n    if b == 0.0 {\n        Err(DivisionError::DivideByZero)\n    } else {\n        Ok(a / b)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMany languages now have similar patterns (TypeScript with `Either`, Go with multiple retur",

This helps you handle different error types appropriately.\n\n```python\n# \u274c Too broad\ntry:\n    do_something()\nexcept Exception:\n    pass\n\n# \u2705 Specific\ntry:\n    do_something()\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    handle_missing_file()\nexcept PermissionError:\n    handle_permission_issue()\n```\n\n### 3. **Provide Context**\nError messages should explain what went wrong, where, and ideally how to fix it.\n\n```javascript\n// \u274c Unhelpful\nthrow new Error(\"Invalid input\");\n\n// \u2705 Helpful\nthrow new Error(`User ID must be a positive integer, got: ${userId}`);\n```\n\n### 4. **Use Appropriate Error Types**\n- **Recoverable errors**: Return error values, use Result types, or throw catchable exceptions\n- **Unrecoverable errors**: Panic/crash with a clear message\n- **Expected failures**: Use return values (like `null`, `Option`, or `Result`)\n\n### 5. **Don't Swallow Errors**\n```javascript\n// \u274c Silent failure\ntry {\n    riskyOperation();\n} catch (e) {\n    // nothing here\n}\n\n// \u2705 At minimum, log it\ntry {\n    riskyOperation();\n} catch (e) {\n    logger.error(\"Operation failed\", { error: e });\n    // Then decide: rethrow, return default, or handl",

Creates a copy of the array using the spread operator (`[...arr]`) to avoid mutating the original\n2. Uses the built-in `sort()` method with a comparator function for numerical sorting\n\n### Usage examples:\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3];\nconsole.log(sortArray(numbers)); // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]\n\nconst decimals = [3.14, 1.41, 2.72];\nconsole.log(sortArray(decimals)); // [1.41, 2.72, 3.14]\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you need different variations, here are some alternatives:\n\n**For strings (alphabetical):**\n```javascript\nfunction sortStrings(arr) {\n  return [...arr].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));\n}\n```\n\n**Descending order:**\n```javascript\nfunction sortDescending(arr) {\n  return [...arr].sort((a, b) => b - a);\n}\n```\n\n**Generic with custom comparator:**\n```javascript\nfunction sortArray(arr, compareFn = (a, b) => a - b) {\n  return [...arr].sort(compareFn);\n}\n```\n\nWould you like me to implement a specific sorting algorithm (like quicksort, mergesort, etc.) or adapt this for a particular use case?",
