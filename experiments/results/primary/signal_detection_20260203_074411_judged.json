Your architecture (what's between the client and the origin server)?\n2. Any relevant timeout configurations?\n3. A sample of what the logs show when a 504 occurs (even if they seem unhelpful)?\n4. Whether you have APM/tracing that shows where requests are spending time?\n\nIf you have access to your infrastructure configs or logs, I can help analyze them directly."

Here are the next-level diagnostics to consider:\n\n## Key Areas to Investigate\n\n### 1. **Identify the Pattern**\n- Are the 504s happening at specific times (peak load, scheduled jobs)?\n- Are they affecting specific endpoints or random?\n- What's the frequency - sporadic or clustered?\n\n### 2. **Check Upstream Service Health**\n- Is the backend service under memory/CPU pressure during failures?\n- Are there any slow database queries or external API calls timing out?\n- Check for connection pool exhaustion\n\n### 3. **Proxy/Load Balancer Timeouts**\n- What's between the client and your backend? (nginx, HAProxy, cloud LB, API gateway)\n- Compare timeout settings across the chain - often one layer has a shorter timeout than the actual processing time\n\n### 4. **Network-Level Issues**\n- DNS resolution delays\n- Connection resets or keep-alive misconfigurations\n- Container/pod networking issues if using Kubernetes\n\n## How I Can Help\n\nWould you like me to help you:\n- **Analyze logs** - if you can share relevant log snippets or point me to log files\n- **Review configuration** - nginx/proxy timeout settings, service configs\n- **Search your codebase** - for timeout configurations, slow endpoints, or specifi",

When an API endpoint returns \"coming soon\" for every request, it typically means one of a few things:\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. **The endpoint isn't implemented yet** - The API provider has defined the route but hasn't built the functionality\n2. **Feature flag / environment issue** - The feature might be disabled in the environment you're hitting (e.g., sandbox vs production)\n3. **Incorrect API version** - You might be calling a deprecated or future version of the API\n4. **Authentication/authorization issue** - Some APIs return generic messages instead of proper 401/403 errors\n\n## Suggested Next Steps\n\n1. **Check the API documentation** - Confirm the endpoint is actually available and not listed as \"beta\" or \"upcoming\"\n\n2. **Verify your environment** - Make sure you're hitting the correct base URL (production vs staging vs sandbox)\n\n3. **Check API versioning** - Look at your request headers for version specifications:\n   ```\n   Accept: application/vnd.api+json; version=2\n   # or\n   X-API-Version: 2024-01-01\n   ```\n\n4. **Contact the API provider** - If the docs say it should work, reach out to their support with:\n   - The exact endpoint you're calling\n   - Your request headers and body\n   - The full response you're receiving\n\n5. **Check their status page** - Some providers have status pages showing feature availability\n\nWould you like help with any of these steps?

Check connection pool settings and timeout configurations.\n\n5. **Load Balancer Health Checks** - These might be failing intermittently if the health check endpoints are now slower to respond.\n\nWould you like help investigating any specific symptoms you're seeing?

Services might be resolving to old IPs or timing out on lookups.\n\n2. **Firewall/security group rules** - New network configurations sometimes block ports that were previously open, or change allowed IP ranges.\n\n3. **Service discovery** - If you're using tools like Consul, Kubernetes DNS, or similar, they may need time to propagate or may have stale entries.\n\n4. **Timeouts and connection pooling** - Existing connection pools might be holding onto stale connections. Services may need restarts to pick up new network paths.\n\n5. **Load balancer health checks** - These might be failing intermittently if the health check endpoints are having network issues.\n\nWould you like help investigating any specific aspect of the flakiness?

Check logs for connection timeouts, refused connections, or DNS errors\n4. Verify all required ports are open between services\n5.

I can trace dependencies to find what's touching this code.\n\n3. **Missing regression test** - Each time you fixed it, was a specific test added for that exact scenario? If not, let's add one now.\n\n**Process: Understand the pattern**\n- Are these regressions from the same area of the codebase or different changes each time?\n- Is there a shared dependency or state that multiple features rely on?\n\nWhat would be most helpful right now - diving into the current breakage, or stepping back to understand why this keeps happening?",

Check for long-running queries or locks:**\n```bash\n# PostgreSQL - find blocking queries\npsql -c \"SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query, state \nFROM pg_stat_activity \nWHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '30 seconds'\nORDER BY duration DESC;\"\n```\n\n**4. Check application logs:**\n```bash\n# Look for connection errors\ntail -100 /var/log/your-app/error.log | grep -i \"connection\\|timeout\\|database\"\n```\n\n**5. Check database server resources:**\n```bash\n# If you have access to the DB server\ntop -bn1 | head -20\ndf -h\nfree -m\n```\n\n## Common Causes & Quick Fixes\n\n| Cause | Quick Fix |\n|-------|-----------|\n| **Connection pool exhausted** | Restart app servers to release con",

Shared vs. Isolated** - Use shared fixtures for read-only data, isolated copies for tests that mutate state\n\n**4. Naming Convention** - Name fixtures by what they represent:\n- `validUser.json` / `invalidUser.json`\n- `emptyResponse.json` / `paginatedResponse.json`\n\nIf you can point me to the module or share more details, I can give you specific recommendations tailored to your codebase!",

Here are the key best practices:\n\n## 1. **Infrastructure Parity**\n- Keep both environments **identical** in configuration, capacity, and dependencies\n- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi) to ensure consistency\n- Automate environment provisioning to prevent configuration drift\n\n## 2. **Database Migration Strategy**\n- **Decouple database changes** from application deployments\n- Use backward-compatible schema changes (expand-contract pattern)\n- Avoid destructive migrations until the old version is fully retired\n- Consider shared database vs. separate databases based on your consistency needs\n\n## 3. **Traffic Switching**\n- Use a **router/load balancer** for instant cutover (DNS switching is too slow)\n- Implement health checks before switching traffic\n- Start with **canary releases** (small % of traffic) before full cutover\n- Keep the switch mechanism simple and well-tested\n\n## 4. **Rollback Readiness**\n- Always keep the previous (blue) environment **warm and ready**\n- Define clear rollback triggers and procedures\n- Automate rollback to minimize recovery time\n- Test rollbacks regularly\u2014don't wait for a crisis\n\n## 5. **Session & State Management**\n- Use **externalized session storage** (Redis, database) so sessions survive the switch\n- Design applications to be stateless where possible\n- ",
