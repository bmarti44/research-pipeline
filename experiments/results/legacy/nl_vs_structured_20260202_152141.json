Here's a guide to configuring it:\n\n## Basic Setup\n\n1. **Install webpack**:\n   ```bash\n   npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a configuration file** (`webpack.config.js` in your project root):\n   ```javascript\n   const path = require('path');\n\n   module.exports = {\n     entry: './src/index.js',\n     output: {\n       filename: 'bundle.js',\n       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n     },\n   };\n   ```\n\n## Key Configuration Options\n\n### Entry\nDefines the entry point(s) for your application:\n```javascript\nentry: './src/index.js',\n// or multiple entries:\nentry: {\n  app: './src/app.js',\n  vendor: './src/vendor.js',\n}\n```\n\n### Output\nWhere the bundled files go:\n```javascript\noutput: {\n  filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n  clean: true, // cleans /dist before each build\n}\n```\n\n### Mode\nSet the build mode:\n```javascript\nmode: 'development', // or 'production'\n```\n\n### Loaders\nTransform files (CSS, images, TypeScript, etc.):\n```javascript\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.css$/,\n      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],\n    },\n    {\n      test: /\\.(png|svg|jpg|gif)$/,\n      type: 'asset/resource',\n    },\n    {\n      test: /\\.tsx?$/,\n      use: 'ts-loader',\n      exclude: /node_modules/,\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Plugins\nExtend webpack's capabilities:\n```javascript\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')",

It automatically wraps the return value in a Promise.\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  return \"Hello\"; // Automatically becomes Promise.resolve(\"Hello\")\n}\n```\n\n### `await` keyword\nPauses execution of an async function until a Promise resolves. Can only be used inside an `async` function.\n\n```javascript\nasync function getData() {\n  const result = await fetch('/api/data'); // Waits here until fetch completes\n  const json = await result.json();        // Then waits here\n  return json;\n}\n```\n\n## Why Use It?\n\n**Before (Promise chains):**\n```javascript\nfunction getUserData(userId) {\n  return fetch(`/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(user => fetch(`/posts/${user.id}`))\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .catch(error => console.error(error));\n}\n```\n\n**After (async/await):**\n```javascript\nasync function getUserData(userId) {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(`/users/${userId}`);\n    const user = await response.json();\n    const postsResponse = await fetch(`/posts/${user.id}`);\n    return await postsResponse.json();\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Error handling** - Use `try/catch` blocks, just like synchronous code\n2. **Parallel exec",
