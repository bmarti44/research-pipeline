abstract: >-
  A fully autonomous research pipeline that takes a natural language
  hypothesis about LLM/AI behavior and produces a complete, PDF-ready
  academic paper. Orchestrated by a Claude Code agent with 9 specialized
  expert sub-agents, featuring stage-gated execution, hash-locked
  preregistration, 5-round expert review, and deterministic verification.
