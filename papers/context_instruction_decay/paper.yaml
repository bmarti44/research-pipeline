  abstract: |
    We investigate how instruction adherence degrades as context length increases,
    testing whether different instruction categories show different decay rates.
    In a preregistered study across context lengths from 1K to 128K tokens, we find
    that instruction decay is non-uniform: safety/refusal instructions degrade
    significantly slower than formatting instructions, which degrade slower than
    factual constraint instructions. Furthermore, decay follows a non-linear pattern
    with a model-specific "cliff" where compliance drops sharply. These findings
    have direct implications for instruction placement and redundancy strategies
    in production LLM systems.

    hypothesis: |
      As context length increases, safety/refusal instructions degrade slower
      than formatting instructions, which degrade slower than factual constraints.

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Long-context models are deployed but instruction decay is poorly understood
    2. We hypothesize decay rates differ by instruction type
    3. Systematic test across 5 instruction categories and 8 context lengths
    4. Find safety instructions most robust, factual constraints most fragile
    5. Identify model-specific "cliff" points for production guidance

  key_contribution: |
    First systematic categorization of instruction decay rates, showing safety
    instructions are most robust while factual constraints are most vulnerable.

  implications:
    - Safety instructions can be placed once; factual constraints need reinforcement
    - Context length limits should be set based on instruction category requirements
    - Redundant instruction placement varies by instruction criticality
