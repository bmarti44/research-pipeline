      "description": "The manuscript mischaracterizes M3's forward-pass architecture. Section 3.1 states 'The model executes six sequential forward passes, with each pass reading the previous pass's output as input.' and Section 3.2 states 'M3's six sequential passes through 12 transformer layers produce 72 effective layers of computation.' Examination of the actual code (coconut.py lines 114-257) reveals that M3 uses a KV-cache-based incremental computation strategy, NOT six full forward passes. The first iteration processes all tokens from position 0 up to the first latent token. Each subsequent iteration processes only a SINGLE token position (the next latent token) while reusing KV cache from prior positions. The 'hidden state recycling' replaces the embedding of the next thought token with the last-layer hidden state from the previous token position (line 209-211), but each subsequent loop iteration is a single-token forward pass, not a full-sequence forward pass. The total computation is NOT 6x12=72 effective layers for the thought-token region. It is 12 layers for the initial prefix, plus 12 layers per thought token (6 single-token passes), plus 12 layers for the final post-thought region -- but the KV cache means the total FLOPs are proportional to sequence_length * 12 layers * (max_n_latents + 1), not to sequence_length * 72 layers. The '72 effective layers' framing substantially overstates the computational asymmetry between M3 and M5. The actual asymmetry is that M3 processes thought tokens SEQUENTIALLY (each depends on the prior's output) while M5 processes them in PARALLEL within a single forward pass. This is still a meaningful difference, but it is a sequential-vs-parallel computation difference, not a 6x depth difference. The '72 effective layers' claim is repeated in the Limitations section and underpins the paper's 'sequential bottleneck' interpretation.",
      "location": "Section 3.1 (paragraph describing M3), Section 3.2 (final paragraph), Section 5.3, Section 6 (Forward-pass asymmetry)",
      "recommendation": "Correct the architectural description. M3 does not execute six full forward passes through 12 layers each. It executes one initial forward pass (prefix up to first thought token), then 5-6 incremental single-token forward passes (one per thought token, using KV cache), plus a final pass for the post-thought tokens. Each thought token sees 12 layers of computation, but the KV cache ensures that prior tokens are not reprocessed. The correct characterization is: each thought position's representation is computed by a 12-layer forward pass conditioned on the KV cache of all preceding positions, with its embedding replaced by the previous position's final hidden state. The sequential dependency is real -- thought token k cannot be computed until thought token k-1 finishes -- but the total effective depth per thought position is 12 layers, not 72. The FLOP difference between M3 and M5 arises from the sequential nature of M3 (preventing parallelism of thought tokens) rather than from multiplicative depth increase.",

      "description": "The hidden-state recycling description contains a subtle inaccuracy that affects interpretive claims. Section 3.1 states that M3's thought tokens contain 'the recycled final-layer hidden state from the previous forward pass.' The code (line 209-211) shows the actual operation: tensor_list[batch_idx][token_idx] = hidden_states[batch_idx, token_idx - 1 - hidden_states_offset, :]. This takes the hidden state from the PREVIOUS POSITION (token_idx - 1), not from 'the previous forward pass' in general. The distinction matters: in the first loop iteration, the hidden state at token_idx-1 is the hidden state of the last input token before the first thought position, NOT a thought token's hidden state. So the first thought token receives the input context's final hidden state, the second receives the first thought token's hidden state, etc. This creates a chain where the first thought position is architecturally different from subsequent ones -- it bridges from input space to thought space. The paper's probing analysis may reflect this: M3's peak accuracy at layer 0 for position 3 makes sense because the recycled hidden state at position 3 has already been through the full model at the prior position, so it arrives pre-processed at layer 0. But positions 0-2 have different computational histories: position 0 receives the last input token's hidden state (which has seen no thought tokens), while position 2 receives position 1's hidden state (which has seen two thought tokens). This asymmetry is not discussed.",

      "description": "The paper's framing of 'reasoning vs. buffering' is a false dichotomy that the paper's own evidence refutes, yet the title and much of the narrative maintain it. The probing results show +52pp step-specific selectivity at position 3 for BOTH models. This is structured, step-specific computation -- not 'buffering' in any standard sense. A buffer carries no task-relevant structure; these positions clearly do. The paper partially acknowledges this in Section 5.1 ('the evidence does not support pure buffering in the sense of unstructured generic computation') but this important nuance is buried rather than foregrounded. The convergent evidence table (Table 6) lists the buffering prediction for probing as 'Shared curriculum-driven pattern' rather than 'general broadcast' (an improvement from an earlier version), but the selectivity profiles are neither 'sequential reasoning' nor 'buffering' -- they are curriculum-driven structured computation. The round 1 domain expert review (D001, D014) raised this framing issue as a major concern. The current manuscript partially addresses it (the Table 6 labels were improved, and the buffering caveat was added to Section 5.1) but the title still frames the binary. The 'Does COCONUT Reason or Buffer?' title promises a binary answer the evidence does not support.",

      "description": "The paper does not adequately engage with the attention-routing implications of M3 vs. M5. In M3, because of KV-cache-based sequential processing, thought token k can attend to all input tokens AND all prior thought tokens 0 through k-1 (via KV cache from prior passes). In M5, because of standard causal self-attention in a single forward pass, thought token k can ALSO attend to all input tokens and all prior thought tokens 0 through k-1. The attention connectivity is actually IDENTICAL between M3 and M5 for the thought-token region. The key difference is only in WHAT occupies the embedding at each thought position: M3 has the previous position's final-layer hidden state (pre-processed information), while M5 has a fixed learned embedding (no pre-processed information). This means the comparison is more precisely about whether pre-processing the embedding via recycling provides value beyond what standard attention-based information routing achieves. The paper's narrative of M5 having 'more flexible' attention (Section 4.4, 5.3) is incorrect: both models have identical causal attention masks over the same positions. The flexibility difference lies in the embedding content, not in the attention structure.",

The paper correctly notes that their probing methodology tests for step-sequential encoding rather than BFS superposition (Section 5.4), and correctly acknowledges that a multi-label probe would be needed to test the BFS hypothesis. However, the paper then proceeds to draw strong conclusions ('the theoretical expressiveness is not realized in practice') based on probes that, by the authors' own admission, cannot detect the phenomenon the theory predicts. The correct conclusion is more limited: the probing analysis shows no evidence of step-sequential encoding (which would be one possible manifestation of latent reasoning), but does not test for BFS-style superposition (which is the specific mechanism Hao et al. and Zhu et al. propose). Drawing a negative conclusion about the realization of BFS expressiveness based on probes that cannot detect BFS is a logical gap.",

      "description": "The probing results for M3 at layer 0 require more careful interpretation given the recycling architecture. The paper reports M3's peak probe accuracy at (layer 0, position 3) = 55.4%. Because M3 recycles the final-layer hidden state from position 2 into the embedding of position 3, this layer-0 activation at position 3 is actually the output of the full 12-layer transformer applied to position 2's input. So 'layer 0' for M3 at recycled positions is not comparable to 'layer 0' for M5 (which is the raw embedding layer). The paper notes this briefly ('M3's peak probe accuracy occurs at layer 0, position 3. Because COCONUT recycles the final-layer hidden state back into the input embedding stream, the recycled representation arrives pre-processed at layer 0'), but does not fully address the comparability issue. When the paper compares 'M3 has 29/78 significant cells' vs 'M5 has 11/78', the counts are inflated for M3 because layer 0 at recycled positions already contains 12 layers of processing. A fairer comparison might exclude layer 0 from M3's count at recycled positions, or compare M3's layer-0 probes with M5's layer-12 probes.",

M3's inference FLOPs are NOT 6x M5's. With KV cache, M3 processes the input prefix once (same as M5), then processes each thought token individually in sequence (6 single-token forward passes of 12 layers each), then processes the final answer. The overhead for thought tokens in M3 is 6 sequential single-token forward passes. M5 processes all thought tokens in one forward pass (but the attention computation scales quadratically with position). The actual FLOP ratio depends on the sequence length and is likely closer to 2-3x than 6x for typical ProsQA sequence lengths.

Zero permutation flips means the model's predictions are invariant to the ordering of thought tokens -- yet corrupting position 3 alone causes catastrophic failure. This means position 3 is critical BY CONTENT but not BY POSITION. The most parsimonious explanation is that the model attends to thought positions based on activation content rather than positional encoding, so moving a critical activation from position 3 to position 0 (via permutation) does not disrupt the computation because causal attention can still find and attend to it. The paper's 'broadcast-then-attend' narrative captures part of this but does not explicitly address the content-vs-position tension.

Given the corrected understanding of M3's architecture (KV-cache-based sequential processing, not 6 full forward passes), an alternative explanation should be considered: DAGs introduce convergent paths where multiple branches lead to the same node. In M3, because each thought token's embedding contains the previous position's final hidden state, there is an explicit recurrence that could allow the model to accumulate information across thought tokens. In M5, all thought tokens start with the same fixed embedding, so any accumulation must happen entirely through attention. DAG problems may require a kind of path-tracking that benefits from the explicit recurrence in M3. However, the simpler explanation -- that M3's sequential processing naturally handles the sequential nature of convergent path evaluation, while M5 must discover this routing through attention alone -- is equally plausible.

Several major issues require attention: the hidden-state recycling mechanism description needs correction (F002), the attention connectivity between M3 and M5 is incorrectly characterized as different when it is actually identical (F004), and the BFS hypothesis treatment draws overly strong negative conclusions from probes not designed to detect BFS (F005). The 'reasoning vs. buffering' framing (F003) remains a concern but is more of a scientific communication choice than a factual error. With the critical and major issues resolved -- particularly the architectural description in F001 -- the paper would make a solid contribution to understanding latent reasoning architectures. The core finding that the curriculum drives performance is well-supported by the data, even though several of the mechanistic interpretations built on top of this finding need recalibration once the architecture is correctly understood."
