The two critical findings from round 2 (forward-pass asymmetry, equivalence testing) are now partially resolved through extensive manuscript revisions — the confound is transparently acknowledged, language has been softened, and the CI for the primary comparison is reported. The remaining conditions are achievable through targeted text edits (adding single-seed caveats, softening 'identical' to 'qualitatively similar', correcting layer range descriptions, reframing the expressiveness claim). No new critical issues were introduced. Data integrity is strong: 312 numbers verified across 15 tables with zero manuscript-level discrepancies. The paper is ready for final targeted revisions followed by publishability assessment."
