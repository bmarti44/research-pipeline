      "description": "Forward-pass asymmetry framing in Section 5.3 has been substantially improved since round 2. The manuscript now explicitly names both confounded factors ('sequential dependency and additional computation') in Section 5.3 (line 253), acknowledges that the OOD comparison 'cannot isolate the cause' (line 251), presents both the sequential-bottleneck and the capacity-regularization interpretations as equally valid alternatives (line 255), and proposes the necessary third control in Section 6 (line 279). The language is appropriately hedged: 'One interpretation' and 'An alternative interpretation' rather than causal claims. However, the phrase 'sequential-bottleneck account' (Section 5.3, line 255) still implicitly foregrounds the content-related interpretation by naming it first and giving it a concrete mechanism ('computation pattern optimized for training-distribution chain lengths'), while the capacity alternative is described more generically ('a general capacity advantage'). This is a subtle framing asymmetry but not a serious issue. The abstract and conclusion now consistently include the caveat 'confounded by differences in sequential processing structure' when discussing OOD results. This represents adequate resolution of R2_F001.",

      "recommendation": "Consider giving the capacity-regularization alternative the same level of mechanistic specificity as the sequential-bottleneck account. For example: 'An alternative interpretation is that M3's 72 effective layers of computation (12 layers per pass times 6 passes) overfit to training-distribution patterns, while M5's 12 effective layers provide implicit regularization that aids extrapolation to novel chain lengths.' This would make the two alternatives more symmetrically specified.",

      "description": "The central claim framing has been partially adjusted but remains subtly inconsistent across sections. The abstract (line 6) states 'the curriculum, not the continuous latent mechanism, drives COCONUT's in-distribution performance.' The conclusion (line 291) states 'COCONUT's in-distribution performance on ProsQA is primarily attributable to its training curriculum, not to the content of the recycled hidden states.' These two framings differ: the abstract attributes performance to 'the curriculum' (positive attribution), while the conclusion attributes it to 'not the content' (negative attribution). The conclusion's framing is more defensible given that the curriculum-only ablation is absent (R2_F004). The paper cannot positively attribute performance to the curriculum alone because the curriculum has not been tested without thought tokens. What the paper CAN claim is that the specific mechanism (recycling vs. pause) does not matter when curriculum is held constant. Section 5.1 (line 223) uses the weakest and most appropriate framing: 'the data favor curriculum-driven computation.' The introduction's contribution statement (line 18) correctly says the mechanism 'is not the causal source.' These framings range from strong (abstract) to appropriate (Section 5.1, Introduction).",

The sentence in Section 4.3 (line 193) 'We therefore treat the MLP probe results as inconclusive' correctly downgrades the status.

The limitations section (Section 6, line 277) discusses single-seed thoroughly, but the results section does not echo this caveat. Readers who focus on the results section without reading the limitations may overinterpret the OOD differences. The round 2 review specifically recommended 'add a sentence to the OOD results section (not just Limitations) acknowledging that the OOD advantages are preliminary single-seed observations.' This has not been done. The conclusion (line 289) says 'the pause baseline outperforms COCONUT on 3 of 4 test sets' without qualification.

      "description": "The selectivity metric reported in Table 4 and the text uses inconsistent reference layers across the two models, which undermines the direct comparability of the '+52.0pp vs. +52.3pp' comparison. For M3, Table 4 states 'selectivity is reported at layer 0 for positions 0, 1, and 3 (where recycled hidden states are injected) and layer 12 for position 2' (line 166). For M5, 'selectivity is reported at layer 12 (peak accuracy layer) for all positions' (line 166). This means the selectivity values being compared between M3 and M5 come from different layers: M3's position 3 selectivity (+52.0pp) is measured at layer 0, while M5's position 3 selectivity (+52.3pp) is measured at layer 12. Verifying against selectivity_recomputed.json: M3 at (layer 0, position 3) has selectivity 0.5202 (+52.0pp), confirmed. M5 at (layer 12, position 3) has selectivity 0.5234 (+52.3pp), confirmed. The values are indeed nearly identical, which supports the paper's conclusion. However, for a rigorous comparison, the paper should either: (a) report selectivity at the same layer for both models, or (b) acknowledge that comparing different layers is comparing different representations and explain why this is still meaningful. The paper does acknowledge the architectural reason (M3 injects at layer 0, M5 builds through the stack), but the selectivity comparison is still presented as though the numbers are directly comparable. M3 at layer 12, position 3 has selectivity 0.5234 (from the raw grid), essentially identical to M5 at layer 12 -- so the claim holds regardless of layer choice, but this should be verified and noted.",

      "description": "The probing experiment's claim of 'identical selectivity profiles' (Section 4.3, line 183; Section 5.2, line 241; abstract line 6) may overstate the similarity at positions 0 and 1. The selectivity values at positions 0-1 reported in Table 4 are M3: -15.6pp, -10.6pp and M5: -12.0pp, -14.6pp. These show the same qualitative pattern (anti-selectivity at both positions) but the specific values differ: position 0 has a 3.6pp difference (M3 more anti-selective) and position 1 has a 4.0pp difference (M5 more anti-selective). The paper describes these as 'near-identical' without providing any statistical test of whether the difference in selectivity between models is significant. At position 3, the 0.3pp difference is convincingly negligible, but the 3.6-4.0pp differences at positions 0-1 may be meaningful given the sample size of n=500. Without confidence intervals or a formal comparison test on selectivity values, calling the profiles 'identical' is an informal judgment. The selectivity_recomputed.json data shows that M3 at layer 0, position 0 has raw selectivity -0.156 and M5 at layer 12, position 0 has raw selectivity -0.120; at layer 0, position 1 M3 has -0.106 and M5 layer 12 position 1 has -0.146.

However, an interesting and unremarked detail is that M5 under M3-scale noise shows LESS pre-cliff degradation than M5 under M5-scale noise: at 3 positions corrupted, M5+M5noise = 95.8% vs. M5+M3noise = 96.4%. This is counterintuitive -- larger noise produces less degradation above the cliff. One explanation is that M3-scale random vectors are so far from M5's pause embedding manifold that the model effectively ignores them via attention mechanisms (treating them as out-of-distribution tokens), while M5-scale noise is close enough to the pause embedding to partially interfere with the model's learned processing. This is a minor analytical point but suggests the corruption experiments are not strictly monotonic with perturbation magnitude above the cliff, which could be noted.",

However, the paper does not explain why the sample count drops so sharply between positions 2 and 3. Since ProsQA has path lengths of 3-6 hops, and there are 6 thought positions (0-5), position 3 corresponds to step 3 of the reasoning path. Only samples with path length >= 4 have a step 3 entity to decode, and 298/500 samples have path length >= 4. This is implicit but could confuse readers who expect all 500 samples at all positions. More importantly, this means the selectivity comparison between position 2 (n=500) and position 3 (n=298) uses different subsets of the data, potentially introducing a selection bias: position-3 probes are trained only on longer problems, which might systematically differ from shorter problems in ways that affect probe accuracy.",

If there is a seed-specific artifact that causes both models to converge to similar representations, all six diagnostics would show convergence without this reflecting a general pattern.

  "summary": "The manuscript has improved substantially since round 2, resolving 16 of 20 prior findings fully and 4 partially. The core experimental design -- a curriculum-matched pause-token baseline compared against COCONUT across three experimental paradigms -- is sound, creative, and important. Four issues require attention before proceeding: (1) the OOD results section and conclusion need in-line single-seed caveats (R3_F004); (2) the cross-layer selectivity comparison should be verified at matching layers and noted (R3_F005); (3) 'identical selectivity profiles' should be softened to 'qualitatively similar' given 3-4pp differences at positions 0-1 (R3_F008); and (4) the 'independent' in the convergent evidence claim should be qualified to distinguish methodological independence from statistical independence given single-seed conditioning (R3_F012). None of these are fatal -- they are precision improvements to an already strong manuscript. The paper's central contribution (M5 matches M3 under matched curriculum, p = 0.845) is robust and well-supported."
