The manuscript now accurately describes M3's inference as: 'after a full forward pass over the input prefix, each subsequent thought token is processed as a single-token forward pass using KV-cache incremental decoding, with the previous position's final-layer hidden state injected as the current position's input embedding' (Section 3.2). The '6 full forward passes' and '72 effective layers' language has been entirely removed. The new description correctly characterizes the sequential dependency without overstating the computational depth. Section 3.1's worked example now states 'the model first processes the input prefix in a single forward pass, then processes each thought token sequentially via KV-cache incremental decoding.' This is technically accurate."

      "description": "The forward-pass asymmetry confound is now well-described in Section 3.2 and Section 6, but the manuscript does not acknowledge a subtler implication: M3's KV-cache incremental decoding means that each thought token's self-attention computation conditions on a KV cache that was built with the PREVIOUS thought token's recycled hidden state as input. In contrast, M5's single-pass computation means all thought tokens' self-attention is computed simultaneously with KV entries built from the same fixed pause embedding at every thought position. The practical consequence is that in M3, when thought token k attends to position k-1 in the KV cache, the key and value vectors at position k-1 were computed from the recycled hidden state (rich, variable, problem-dependent). In M5, when thought token k attends to position k-1, the key and value vectors at position k-1 were computed from the fixed pause embedding (identical across problems). This means the information available through attention is actually DIFFERENT between M3 and M5, even though both use causal attention over the same positions. The round 2 review's F004 (which said attention connectivity is 'identical') was corrected, but the correction slightly oversimplified: the attention MASK is identical, but the attention CONTENT (keys and values) differs because of the different embeddings at thought positions. The current manuscript handles this correctly in principle -- it says the difference is in 'what occupies those positions' -- but does not explicitly note that this difference propagates through the KV cache to affect what information is retrievable by later positions through attention.",

This means that later positions' attention over earlier thought positions retrieves qualitatively different information in the two models.'

The text states: 'Our probing analysis shows that the theoretical expressiveness is not realized in practice at GPT-2 124M scale: both models exhibit identical selectivity profiles.' This claim is too strong given the immediately following acknowledgment that 'our probes are not designed to detect the BFS superposition states that Zhu et al. prove are expressible.' You cannot simultaneously claim that expressiveness is 'not realized' and acknowledge that your probes cannot detect the form of expressiveness the theory predicts. The other convergent evidence (permutation insensitivity, transplant tolerance, corruption profiles) is consistent with the absence of BFS but does not directly test for superposition states either. Permutation insensitivity is actually compatible with BFS superposition: if all positions simultaneously encode all frontier nodes, reordering them would be irrelevant. The correct claim is that the probing and behavioral evidence is consistent with the curriculum-driven account and does not require invoking BFS expressiveness, but does not rule it out.",

This needs verification against the actual code architecture described in pause_embedding_architecture.txt. The architecture file confirms: 'M5 performs a single forward pass (no multi-pass recurrence). All positions in the input that contain the <|latent|> token ID are replaced with the learned pause_embedding before the forward pass.' This is consistent with the manuscript. However, the manuscript does not clarify an important detail: after the single forward pass, M5 then generates answer tokens autoregressively. The 'single forward pass' description applies to the processing of the input + thought tokens, but the answer generation is still autoregressive (multiple forward passes for multiple answer tokens). The manuscript should make this explicit, because a reader might interpret 'single forward pass' as meaning M5 produces its entire output in one pass, which would be architecturally impossible for autoregressive generation.",

The manuscript reports M3 position 3 selectivity as +52.0pp and M5 as +52.3pp. From selectivity_recomputed.json, M3's selectivity_raw_grid at layer 0, position 3 is 0.5202569... (52.0pp) and at layer 12, position 3 is 0.5233986... (52.3pp). For M5, layer 12 position 3 is 0.523397726... (52.3pp). The numbers are consistent. However, Table 4 reports 'Peak probe accuracy: 55.4% (M3)' at '(0, 3)' and '57.0% (M5)' at '(12, 3)'. From the matched_accuracy_grid, M3 at (0, 3) = 0.5536912... = 55.4%, and M5 at (12, 3) = 0.5704697... = 57.0%. These match. The text also reports max_cross_accuracy for M3 at position 3 as 3.3% and for M5 as 4.7%. From max_cross_accuracy_grid: M3 at (0, 3) = 0.03343... = 3.3%, M5 at (12, 3) = 0.04707... = 4.7%. All numbers verify correctly. The one issue is that the manuscript reports M3's selectivity 'at layer 0 for positions 0, 1, and 3 (where recycled hidden states are injected) and layer 12 for position 2.' However, looking at the selectivity_raw_grid, the MAXIMUM selectivity for M3 position 0 is at layer 8 (+0.008 = +0.8pp, barely positive), not layer 0 (-0.156 = -15.6pp). The Table 4 reports 'Position 0--1 selectivity: -15.6pp, -10.6pp' for M3, which are the layer 0 values. The text says selectivity is 'reported at layer 0 for positions 0, 1, and 3.' This is technically accurate reporting but potentially misleading: it reports the selectivity at the recycling-injection layer (layer 0), which is the most negative value for positions 0-1, rather than the peak selectivity across layers. For position 0, the peak selectivity across all layers is +0.8pp (layer 8), not -15.6pp (layer 0). The anti-selectivity narrative is true at the injection layer but the positions are not uniformly anti-selective across all layers.",

The anti-selectivity at layer 0 reflects the fact that the recycled hidden state at position 0 comes from the input prefix (which encodes later-step information from the graph facts), not from a prior thought token.'

The manuscript states the pause embedding is 'a single learned embedding vector of 768 dimensions (nn.Parameter)' (Section 3.2), initialized from the base model's latent token, but does not mention the upstream initialization from '<<'. While this level of detail may seem excessive, it matters for reproducibility: a reader trying to replicate M5 needs to know that the pause embedding is initialized from a specific token's embedding, not randomly.

The 0/78 count implies a systematic test was run and yielded a clean null result. In reality, 0/78 where MLP exceeds linear is the expected outcome when MLP probes fail to converge -- they would produce random or near-zero accuracy, which would trivially be below the linear probe's accuracy at every cell.

Quiet-STaR does not operate 'without requiring explicit supervision' in the same sense as COCONUT. Quiet-STaR generates explicit (though hidden from the user) reasoning tokens at each position and uses REINFORCE to optimize them based on downstream next-token prediction loss.

The distinction from COCONUT is that Quiet-STaR's reasoning is tokenized (discrete) but hidden, while COCONUT's is continuous (non-tokenized).

Consider curriculum stage 3 (epochs 15-19), where 3 of the CoT steps are replaced with thought tokens and the remaining steps are still explicit. In M3, the 3 thought positions receive recycled hidden states from the previous position, so the model has access to processed versions of the prior thought tokens' representations. In M5, those 3 positions receive fixed pause embeddings, so the model must learn to route information purely through attention to the remaining explicit CoT tokens. During intermediate curriculum stages, M3 and M5 may learn qualitatively different routing strategies because they have access to different information at thought-token positions. By the final stage (all positions latent), these different learned strategies may converge (as the behavioral results show), but the training trajectories could differ. This is relevant because the paper claims the curriculum is the 'shared factor' -- but the curriculum is only nominally shared; the same curriculum schedule applied to different architectures may teach different things.",

      "description": "The permutation insensitivity result (0% flip rate, 5000 trials) combined with position 3 criticality creates an interpretive puzzle that the manuscript partially addresses but does not fully resolve. The manuscript's 'broadcast-then-attend' account (Section 5.1) explains this well for M5: since all thought tokens have the same embedding, the model must use positional encoding to distinguish them, and if the critical information ends up at all positions through broadcasting, moving tokens around does not matter. But for M3, the explanation is less obvious: M3's thought tokens have different embeddings at each position (recycled hidden states from different processing depths). Permuting M3's thought tokens should change which hidden state appears at which position, yet the model's predictions are invariant. This implies that either (a) M3 attends to thought tokens by content rather than position, or (b) all M3 thought tokens contain redundantly encoded critical information despite their different hidden states. The single-position corruption results favor (a): position 3 is critical to corrupt (destroying its content) but not to move (reordering positions), suggesting content-based routing. The manuscript notes this in the permutation section ('permuting latent tokens does not change the model's output. This does not rule out order-sensitive internal representations that are ultimately redundant for the final prediction.') but does not develop the content-vs-position routing insight.",

When position 3's content is moved to another position by permutation, the model follows it; when position 3's content is destroyed by corruption, no other position compensates.'

Goyal et al. prepended pause tokens to the input at inference time and trained the model from scratch with pause tokens present. M5 uses a progressive curriculum that first trains with explicit CoT and gradually replaces CoT tokens with pause tokens. This is a fundamentally different training regime. Goyal et al.'s pause tokens never had explicit reasoning to replace; they were always 'empty' computation. M5's pause tokens are trained in a context where the model previously had explicit reasoning at those positions and must learn to function without it.

The fact that M3 achieves 97% on GPT-2 124M while the original paper used larger models suggests that ProsQA may be too easy for the scale of models being tested.

In DAG graphs, multiple paths can converge to the same node, creating situations where the correct answer can be reached via different intermediate sequences. M3's sequential recycling creates a Markov-like chain where each thought position is influenced primarily by the immediately preceding position's output. This recurrent structure is similar to an RNN, which is well-suited to sequential traversal of a single path. In contrast, M5's single-pass attention may attempt to process multiple paths simultaneously, which could lead to interference in DAG topologies where paths converge. The DAG advantage for M3 and the longer-chain advantage for M5 are reminiscent of the RNN-vs-transformer tradeoff: RNNs excel at sequential processing but struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers handle long-range attention well but may not naturally perform sequential state tracking.",

      "recommendation": "Consider adding the RNN analogy: 'M3's sequential recycling structure is functionally similar to a recurrent neural network applied to thought positions, potentially explaining its advantage on DAG structures (where sequential path-following is beneficial) and disadvantage on longer chains (where recurrent processing accumulates errors or saturates).' This provides an intuitive explanation grounded in well-understood architecture differences.",

  "summary": "The manuscript has undergone substantial and effective revision since the round 2 domain expert review. The critical architectural mischaracterization (72 effective layers) has been fully corrected, the KV-cache incremental decoding description is now technically accurate, and the treatment of prior work (Zhu et al., Deng et al., Goyal et al., Zhang et al.) is substantively improved. Two issues require resolution before publication: (1) the BFS expressiveness claim in Section 5.4 still overclaims by stating the theoretical expressiveness is 'not realized in practice' based on probes that the authors acknowledge cannot detect the BFS mechanism (F002); and (2) the M5 'single forward pass' description needs clarification that this applies to input+thought processing, with answer generation remaining autoregressive (F003). All other findings are minor or suggestions. The core scientific contribution -- that the curriculum drives COCONUT's in-distribution performance -- is well-supported by converging evidence, and the confounds in the OOD comparison are honestly disclosed. With the two required fixes, this paper is ready for publication."
