      "description": "statistical_analysis.json contains stale McNemar values from an approximate computation (computed from aggregate accuracy, not per-sample data). The approximate p-values differ substantially from the exact values in mcnemar/results.json and mcnemar_verification.json. For example: ProsQA approximate p=0.857 vs exact p=0.845; 7-hop approximate p=0.00148 vs exact p=3.0e-7; DAG approximate Bonferroni p=0.121 (not significant) vs exact Bonferroni p=0.00146 (significant). The approximate McNemar also has incorrect contingency counts (fractional values like b01=14.49, b10=16.49 for ProsQA, which should be 14 and 12). The manuscript correctly uses the exact values throughout and does not reference statistical_analysis.json's McNemar section, so this does not affect the paper's claims.",

However, the corrected data in m5_linear_perm.json shows that layer 7, position 0 is also significant (acc=0.1040, p=0.000500). The Appendix A.1 correctly describes the range as 'layers 7-10 and 12 at position 0'. The body text claim of 'layers 9-12' understates the actual range by two layers.",

Similarly, the Dense CI computes to [1.2254, 1.8804], rounding to [1.23, 1.88], while the manuscript reports [1.22, 1.88]. These are sub-penny differences that do not affect any conclusions.",

M3 probes completed successfully in this run, but M5 required a separate second script execution (probing_m5_log.txt). Both runs used the same parameters (2000 permutations, Bonferroni threshold 0.000641, same sample counts per position), so results are methodologically consistent. However, the crash means M3 and M5 probing results were generated in separate processes, not a single reproducible pipeline execution.",

All contingency tables, accuracy values, corruption curves, probing accuracies, selectivity values, odds ratios, and confidence intervals were independently verified from raw per-sample data. Three minor discrepancies were found: (1) stale/approximate values in statistical_analysis.json and appendix_data.json that are not referenced by the manuscript, (2) a minor body-text inaccuracy about M5's significant probing layers stating '9-12' when the range includes layer 7, and (3) sub-penny rounding differences in two CI bounds. The sole condition requiring resolution is the body-text inconsistency about M5 significant cell layers (F004), which contradicts the Appendix's own correct description."
