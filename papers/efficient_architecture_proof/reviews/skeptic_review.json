The manuscript Table 2 reports M3 test accuracy as 98.0% (citing m3_test_eval.json which says 490/500 = 0.98, best epoch 49). However, all experimental results files report M3 prosqa_test accuracy as 97.0%: the corruption results (clean_accuracy: 0.97), the OOD results (m3 prosqa_test: 0.97), the McNemar verification (verified_m3_accuracy: 0.97), and the per_sample_correctness array (which has exactly 15 false values out of 500 = 485/500 = 0.97). The manuscript uses 98.0% in the abstract, Table 2, and throughout Section 4.1, but 97.0% in Table 3 (corruption clean baseline), Table 5 (OOD ID test), and the convergent evidence table. This means the experiments were run on a different checkpoint or evaluation than the one reported in Table 2. The '85% gap closure' calculation depends on which M3 accuracy is correct: with 98.0%, the gap closure is (95.6 - 83.0) / (98.0 - 83.0) = 84%; with 97.0%, it is (95.6 - 83.0) / (97.0 - 83.0) = 90%. The paper uses 85%, which approximately matches 98.0%, but all mechanistic experiments used the 97.0% model.",

      "description": "The paper's central thesis rests overwhelmingly on null results: zero permutation sensitivity, no corruption effect in early positions, no nonlinear probe advantage, identical selectivity profiles, successful cross-transplantation. The logical structure is: 'We predicted X if reasoning holds; we observed not-X; therefore not-reasoning.' But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Every null result has an alternative explanation: (1) The corruption noise may not have been targeted enough to disrupt reasoning (matched-statistics Gaussian noise destroys structure but might not perturb the model's robust representations). (2) Permutation insensitivity could reflect holographic/distributed encoding where each position stores the full chain redundantly, or set-based encoding. The paper dismisses redundant encoding by noting single-position corruption at position 3 collapses accuracy, but this only rules out COMPLETE redundancy -- partial redundancy with one critical 'index' position is consistent with the data. (3) Linear probes failing to find step-specific information could reflect the probe's inability to decode a nonlinear encoding, and the MLP probe null result is acknowledged to use default hyperparameters that may not have converged. No individual null result is conclusive, and chaining six inconclusive nulls does not produce a conclusive conclusion -- the probability of failing to detect a real effect compounds, it does not cancel.",

Without this, the reader cannot distinguish 'no effect' from 'undetectable effect'.

The paper acknowledges this asymmetry (Section 3.2) and frames it as favoring the paper's argument ('M5 achieves comparable accuracy with substantially less computation'). But this framing conceals a deeper issue: the models are not processing the same information in the same way. M3 has 6x the forward-pass computation, meaning it has 6x the transformer depth (72 effective layers vs. 12). If depth is what matters for ProsQA (plausible given it requires multi-hop reasoning), then M3 may be massively over-provisioned -- it might achieve 97-98% with far fewer passes. The comparison between M3 (6 passes) and M5 (1 pass) is not a clean test of recycling vs. buffering; it is simultaneously a test of 72 effective layers vs. 12 effective layers. The 2.4pp gap (98% vs. 95.6%, or 1pp gap using the experimental 97% vs. 96.6%) could be entirely explained by the depth advantage rather than by the content of the recycled representations.",

The paper's conclusions are presented with broad framing -- 'COCONUT's performance on ProsQA is primarily attributable to its training curriculum' -- but the evidence base is a single scale point. The theoretical results of Zhu et al. (2025) prove that continuous thought tokens are more expressive than discrete tokens, and this expressiveness advantage may only manifest at sufficient scale. At 124M parameters with 12 layers, the model may simply lack the capacity to exploit the continuous thought space, making the recycled hidden states functionally identical to noise from the model's perspective.

This is precisely the type of task where a simple model can memorize or shortcut to the answer without genuine multi-hop reasoning. The training set has only 17,886 samples with a small vocabulary, meaning there are limited entity combinations. Both M3 and M5 could be solving ProsQA through pattern matching or memorization of common graph patterns rather than through any form of reasoning, latent or otherwise. If so, the entire framework of 'reasoning vs. buffering' is moot -- neither model reasons, and the comparison tells us nothing about whether COCONUT can reason on tasks that actually require it.",

The 32-40% disagreement rate on OOD samples (Section 4.4) directly evidences this: the two models disagree on a large fraction of samples, meaning they are NOT doing the same thing. The paper treats similar aggregate accuracy as evidence of similar mechanisms, but two models can achieve 95-97% accuracy through entirely different strategies, especially on a task with binary outputs. The corruption, probing, and transplantation experiments show that the representations are similar on aggregate measures, but these are coarse-grained diagnostics. Two fundamentally different computational strategies could produce similar aggregate statistics while differing on individual samples. The high disagreement rate on OOD data confirms this.",

For M5, position 3 selectivity at layer 12 is 0.523 (52.3pp). But the 'selectivity_aligned_grid' in the same file is STILL ALL ZEROS for both models, and the 'selectivity' field in the probing results.json is STILL ALL ZEROS. The original probing code's selectivity computation was never actually fixed in the pipeline -- it was recomputed separately in the selectivity_recomputed.json file, using a different methodology ('pairwise alignment using min(n_t, n_s) per position pair' per appendix_data.json). This is concerning: the corrected analysis uses a DIFFERENT selectivity computation than the one described in Section 3.4 (which defines selectivity as matched accuracy minus max cross-position accuracy).

      "description": "The paper argues that zero permutation sensitivity proves thought tokens do not encode sequential information. But consider this alternative: the model learned a position-independent representation where each token stores a SET of relevant entities rather than a single entity at a specific reasoning step. In a graph traversal of A -> B -> C -> D, each thought token might store {A, B, C, D} as a superposition or mixture, and the model uses the attention mechanism over the final position to extract the answer. This is consistent with: (1) zero permutation sensitivity (the set is order-invariant), (2) the corruption cliff at position 3 (you need a minimum number of copies of the set to extract the answer reliably), (3) successful cross-transplantation (if most problems share common entities, the sets overlap), and (4) anti-selectivity at positions 0-1 (the set at early positions contains later-step entities, which probes decode as 'anti-selective' because the later-step entity is more salient in the set).

The paper frames this as a 'task-dependent tradeoff' rather than as falsifying evidence, but it is precisely the kind of evidence that would distinguish reasoning from buffering: if the mechanism provides task-specific advantages, it is encoding task-relevant information, which is more than a buffer does.",

      "description": "The nonlinear probe results (Appendix A.7) report that MLP probes 'failed to exceed linear probe accuracy at any cell,' with accuracy <= 0 across all 78 cells for both models. An accuracy of EXACTLY 0 across all 156 cells (78 per model) is itself suspicious -- it suggests the MLP probes completely failed to learn, not that the information is linearly encoded. With 2-layer MLPs and default scikit-learn hyperparameters on a multi-class classification problem with dozens of classes and varying sample sizes (12 to 500), convergence failure is the most likely explanation. The paper acknowledges this possibility but still draws the conclusion that 'no nonlinearly encoded step information exists,' which is not justified if the probe itself did not train.",

      "description": "The paper focuses exclusively on whether thought tokens encode sequential reasoning steps, but never considers the possibility that they encode attention routing patterns. In a transformer, the content of a token position matters less than its role in routing attention. Thought tokens (whether recycled or pause) could serve primarily as attention sinks or routing nodes, directing information flow from input tokens to the answer position. This is neither 'reasoning' (sequential computation) nor 'buffering' (generic compute) -- it is structural attention routing, and it would be consistent with all the observed results: permutation insensitivity (routing is position-independent if mediated by content), corruption cliff (you need enough routing nodes), and successful transplantation (routing patterns are generic).",

  "strongest_alternative_explanation": "Both M3 and M5 solve ProsQA primarily through attention-mediated pattern matching over the input tokens, with thought positions serving as attention routing nodes that allow the model to perform additional computation steps through self-attention. The curriculum teaches both models to consolidate the answer-relevant entity at a specific thought position (position 3), from which the answer head can directly read it. In M3, the recycled hidden states carry this entity as injected content at layer 0, but the model solves the problem from its input tokens regardless (explaining transplantation success). In M5, the same curriculum forces the same routing pattern through positional encodings alone. The models achieve similar in-distribution accuracy because ProsQA's small vocabulary and synthetic structure make pattern matching sufficient -- no genuine multi-hop reasoning is required by either model at 124M scale. The 32-40% OOD disagreement rate reflects different learned shortcuts, not different reasoning strategies. The DAG advantage for M3 arises because the recycled hidden state pipeline provides a useful structural prior for DAG-specific patterns, not because it performs genuine sequential reasoning. In short: neither model reasons; both shortcut; the curriculum teaches the same shortcut; and the remaining differences are architectural artifacts of how each model implements the shortcut, not evidence about reasoning vs. buffering.",

  "summary": "This paper attempts an ambitious and well-structured investigation into whether COCONUT's continuous thought tokens perform latent reasoning or serve as computational buffers. The experimental design is creative, the writing is clear, and the convergent-evidence approach is methodologically sound in principle. The statistical analysis of the OOD results (McNemar tests with Bonferroni correction, independently verified) is properly executed. The paper also demonstrates commendable honesty in its Limitations section, acknowledging single-seed, single-scale, and single-task constraints.\n\nHowever, the paper has three issues I consider fatal in their current form. First, there are data integrity problems: the M3 test accuracy is reported as 98.0% in Table 2 but all experimental backing data shows 97.0%, and M5 shows a similar discrepancy (95.6% vs 96.6%). This undermines the manuscript's quantitative claims and suggests different model checkpoints were used for different experiments without disclosure. Second, the thesis rests entirely on null results (zero permutation flips, identical corruption profiles, identical selectivity) without power analysis to establish what effect sizes these tests could detect. Third, the 6x forward-pass asymmetry between M3 and M5 is a fundamental uncontrolled confound: the comparison simultaneously tests recycling content, computational depth, and inference-time FLOPs, making causal attribution impossible.\n\nBeyond these, the DAG result (M3 significantly outperforms M5, p=0.001) directly contradicts the buffering thesis but is reframed as a 'tradeoff' rather than acknowledged as disconfirming evidence. The paper's own statistical analysis framework rates the evidence as 'inconclusive' (decision_matrix_row: 3), yet the abstract and conclusion present the findings with substantially more confidence. The single-seed limitation means none of the accuracy comparisons or OOD advantages can be attributed to architectural differences rather than initialization-specific training dynamics. With revisions addressing the data integrity issues, the addition of multi-seed results, and a forward-pass-count ablation, this could become a strong contribution. In its current form, the evidence does not support the strength of the claims."
