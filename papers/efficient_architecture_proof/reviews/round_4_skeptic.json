      "description": "The forward-pass asymmetry remains the paper's most serious uncontrolled confound. M3 executes 6 sequential forward passes through 12 transformer layers (72 effective layers of computation), while M5 executes a single forward pass (12 effective layers). The manuscript now acknowledges this in Section 3.2 and Section 6, and even notes the missing control ('a third control that executes six forward passes without recycling... which we leave to future work'). However, acknowledging a confound is not the same as resolving it. Every central claim in the paper -- that M5 'matches' M3 on in-distribution accuracy, that corruption profiles are 'identical', that probing selectivity is 'equivalent' -- is confounded by this 6x compute asymmetry. M5 matching M3 with 1/6 of the forward passes is at least as consistent with 'M3 is massively over-provisioned in compute for ProsQA' as it is with 'the recycling mechanism is unnecessary.' The paper cannot distinguish between these interpretations. More critically, M3's advantage on DAGs (the one case where M3 wins) could be entirely attributable to extra compute depth rather than to the information content of recycled hidden states. Without a control that executes 6 forward passes while injecting fixed embeddings (not recycled states) at each pass, the paper's causal attribution is logically incomplete. The paper's argument that the asymmetry is 'directionally favorable' (Section 3.2) assumes the conclusion it is trying to prove.",

Option (b) would require revising the title, abstract, and conclusion to avoid the phrase 'not the continuous latent mechanism' and instead say something like 'not uniquely attributable to the continuous latent mechanism versus additional computational depth.'",

      "description": "The paper's thesis rests on a chain of null results: zero permutation flips, identical corruption profiles, identical selectivity, successful transplantation. The convergent evidence table (Table 6) is compelling in structure, but every row produces a null or near-null result for distinguishing M3 from M5, and no formal power analysis is provided for ANY of these null comparisons. The permutation test has a documented sensitivity floor (0.06% at 95% confidence from the power analysis in Appendix A.4), but this is the only null test with quantified sensitivity. For the remaining diagnostics -- corruption profile similarity, selectivity similarity (0.3pp difference at position 3), transplantation success, thought-vs-input advantage similarity -- no equivalence testing is performed. The paper treats 'not statistically different' as 'the same,' which is the canonical null-result fallacy. With n=500 samples and binary outcomes, McNemar's test may have adequate power for large effects (which the paper does provide for the OOD comparisons), but the corruption, probing, and transplantation comparisons are assessed informally ('identical profiles,' 'near-identical selectivity') without equivalence bounds. What magnitude of difference in corruption profiles would the paper consider evidence AGAINST the curriculum hypothesis? This is never specified, meaning the hypothesis is unfalsifiable by the paper's own experimental design -- any observed similarity confirms it, and any observed difference (e.g., the DAG result) is explained away as a 'tradeoff.'",

Alternatively, frame all null results using confidence intervals rather than point estimates, so readers can assess how large the true difference might plausibly be. As currently presented, 'identical' is an unsupported characterization -- the appropriate claim is 'not detectably different at n=500 with these measurement instruments.'",

      "description": "The DAG result (M3 outperforms M5 by 7.3pp, p=0.0015 after Bonferroni) is the single strongest piece of evidence against the paper's main thesis, and the paper's handling of it is asymmetric. When M5 outperforms M3 on 3 of 4 OOD datasets, this is interpreted as evidence that the recycling mechanism is a 'sequential bottleneck' that 'constrains generalization.' When M3 outperforms M5 on DAGs, this is interpreted as a 'task-dependent tradeoff' where 'sequential state accumulation may provide a useful inductive bias.' The paper never seriously engages with the possibility that the DAG result indicates genuine reasoning-like computation in M3. If the recycling mechanism merely buffers, why does it provide a statistically significant advantage on a specific graph topology? The paper's explanation ('tracking path convergence') implicitly concedes that the recycled states carry structurally meaningful information -- which is precisely the claim the paper attempts to refute. The framing of M3's DAG advantage as a 'modest benefit' (7.3pp is neither modest nor trivial -- it is the same order of magnitude as M5's advantages on other datasets) reveals a systematic bias in interpretation: M5 advantages are 'substantial' evidence for the thesis while M3 advantages are 'modest tradeoffs.'",

The manuscript acknowledges this in Section 6 and notes that 'the 0.4-percentage-point test-set gap... could widen or reverse under different random initializations.' This is correct but understates the severity. At GPT-2 124M scale with 17K training samples and a 7-stage curriculum, training dynamics are highly sensitive to initialization. The entire paper's contribution hinges on one pair of trained models. Every finding -- the 96.6% vs 97.0% comparison, the corruption profiles, the probing results, the OOD advantages -- describes the behavior of these two specific instances, not the behavior of 'COCONUT-class models' versus 'pause-class models.' The McNemar tests are internally valid (they correctly assess within-instance differences) but do not generalize. A reviewer reading this paper might reasonably ask: if you trained 10 seeds of each model, what fraction would show M5 outperforming M3 on 7-hop? What fraction would show the DAG reversal? What is the between-seed variance of the corruption cliff position? None of these questions can be answered. The paper's previous skeptic review (round 1) flagged this as K010 and recommended 3-5 seeds. The issue remains unresolved.",

      "description": "The selectivity computation has a confusing data provenance trail that was flagged in the round 1 skeptic review (K007) and partially addressed in the revised manuscript (Appendix A.1). However, examining selectivity_recomputed.json reveals that the 'selectivity_aligned_grid' is still ALL ZEROS for both M3 and M5, while the 'selectivity_raw_grid' contains the non-zero values reported in the manuscript (e.g., M3 layer 0, position 3 = 0.520, M5 layer 12, position 3 = 0.523). The manuscript reports Table 4 values derived from the 'raw' grid but does not explain what the 'aligned' grid represents or why it is zero. Furthermore, the 'raw' selectivity values at position 3 vary substantially across layers for M3 (ranging from 0.221 at layer 8 to 0.523 at layer 12), and the manuscript cherry-picks the peak values for comparison. The 'corrected' selectivity reported in Table 4 for M3 uses layer 0, position 3 = 52.0pp, but examining the raw grid, layer 0 position 3 = 0.520 while layer 12 position 3 = 0.523. The manuscript states M3's 'peak probe accuracy' is at layer 0, position 3 (55.4%), but then reports selectivity also at layer 0 -- yet the peak selectivity is actually at layer 12 (0.523pp vs 0.520pp). This is a minor discrepancy, but the overall data provenance remains opaque: two different selectivity grids exist, one is all zeros, and the manuscript selectively reports from the non-zero one.",

      "description": "The paper's probing analysis reveals that M3 has 29/78 significant cells versus M5's 11/78 -- nearly 3x more. M3 also has a higher thought-vs-input advantage (10.5% vs 4.0%). The manuscript acknowledges these differences but dismisses them with: 'this richer encoding does not translate to a behavioral advantage.' However, this dismissal relies on in-distribution accuracy (where both are at ceiling ~97%) as the sole behavioral measure. At ceiling, behavioral differences are undetectable by design -- both models are too accurate for differences to manifest. On OOD data (where behavioral differences ARE detectable), M3 does outperform M5 on DAGs. The paper thus uses ceiling-limited in-distribution accuracy to dismiss a significant representational difference, while the one OOD condition where performance diverges in M3's favor is attributed to a 'tradeoff.' This is a selective application of the 'presence vs. use' distinction: the paper invokes Ravichander et al.'s (2021) argument that decodable information may not be used, but only when it serves the paper's thesis. A more honest framing would be: M3's representations are richer and more broadly distributed, and while this does not help on in-distribution data (both at ceiling), it may contribute to M3's DAG advantage, and we cannot rule out benefits at other scales or tasks.",

      "description": "The title 'Does COCONUT Reason or Buffer?' frames the paper as adjudicating a binary question, but the evidence actually supports a more nuanced answer that the paper itself arrives at: 'the recycling mechanism introduces a task-dependent generalization tradeoff rather than a uniform benefit.' The binary framing biases the reader toward expecting a clean answer, and the paper delivers one ('Buffer, mostly') when the evidence supports something more like 'The curriculum is the dominant factor for in-distribution performance, but the mechanism has task-specific effects on OOD generalization that are neither pure reasoning nor pure buffering.' The abstract's opening contrast ('Does COCONUT Reason or Buffer?') and the conclusion's summary sentence ('COCONUT's performance on ProsQA is primarily attributable to its training curriculum, not to the continuous latent mechanism') flatten a genuinely nuanced finding into a headline. This framing bias manifests throughout: whenever evidence supports the 'buffer' interpretation, it is presented as a main finding; whenever evidence supports the 'reasoning' interpretation (DAG advantage, richer representations, layer-0 probing signal), it is relegated to caveats, limitations, or 'tradeoffs.'",

      "description": "The cross-problem transplantation experiment (Section 4.2) is presented as evidence that thought tokens carry 'no problem-specific content.' However, this experiment has a fundamental design flaw: even after transplanting foreign thought tokens, the model retains access to its original input tokens through self-attention. For M3, the answer-relevant information is already present in the input token hidden states (the graph facts are in the input). The model can simply attend to input positions to solve the problem, treating transplanted thought tokens as noise. For M5, transplanting pause embeddings into a model that already uses pause embeddings is literally replacing nothing with nothing -- the pause embeddings carry no content by design, so transplanting them is vacuous. The fact that transplantation 'succeeds' (accuracy matches clean) is entirely predicted by both the reasoning hypothesis and the buffering hypothesis, making the experiment non-diagnostic. A genuinely informative transplant experiment would (a) transplant thought tokens while masking/corrupting input tokens, testing whether thoughts alone suffice, or (b) transplant thought tokens from a DIFFERENT model architecture (e.g., M3 thoughts into M5 or vice versa), testing cross-architecture compatibility.",

A probe that returns 0% accuracy everywhere has failed as a measurement instrument -- it provides zero evidence about the underlying representation. Drawing ANY conclusion from a failed measurement is invalid. The previous skeptic review (K017) recommended either retraining with proper hyperparameter tuning or removing the claim.

The revised manuscript now consistently uses 97.0% and 96.6%, and Table 2 includes a note explaining the discrepancy ('Training-time evaluation at best epoch yielded slightly higher estimates for M3 (98.0%) and M5 (95.6%), a discrepancy of 5 samples per model attributable to differences in the inference code path'). This is an improvement, but 'differences in the inference code path' is a vague explanation. Five samples per model (1% of the test set) changing outcomes between two evaluation implementations raises the question of whether the models' predictions are stable at the decision boundary. If 10 samples (2% of the test set) are evaluation-code-dependent, the stated 96.6% vs 97.0% comparison itself may not be robust to implementation choices.",

      "recommendation": "Explain specifically what differs between the training-time evaluation code path and the experiment-pipeline evaluation code path. If the difference is in tokenization, batching, or temperature, this should be documented. If 1% of predictions are implementation-sensitive, report this as a source of measurement uncertainty.",

  "summary": "The manuscript has improved substantially since the round 1 skeptic review. The data integrity issues (previously K001, K018) have been resolved with consistent accuracy reporting and transparent disclosure of inference-pipeline discrepancies. The forward-pass asymmetry is now explicitly acknowledged with a clear description of the missing control. The limitations section is honest and substantive. The convergent evidence approach remains the paper's core methodological strength. However, two critical issues persist: (1) the forward-pass confound cannot be resolved without the missing 6-pass fixed-embedding control, and all causal claims about the recycling mechanism's role must be weakened accordingly; (2) the chain of null results requires formal equivalence testing rather than informal characterization as 'identical.' The DAG result remains underweighted in the paper's framing -- it is the strongest evidence that the recycling mechanism has functional consequences, yet it is treated as a caveat rather than a co-equal finding. The single-seed limitation prevents generalization from these specific model instances to architectural claims. With the critical findings addressed (weakened causal language in F001, formal equivalence testing or confidence intervals for null comparisons in F002, and symmetric treatment of the DAG result in F003), the paper would make a solid contribution to understanding latent reasoning architectures."
