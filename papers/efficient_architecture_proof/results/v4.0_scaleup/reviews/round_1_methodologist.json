      "description": "Warm-start design creates fundamental confound: coconut_warmstart is NOT independent of baseline_1000. By initializing COCONUT from the baseline_1000 checkpoint, you are comparing 'baseline trained for 1000 steps' against 'baseline trained for 1000 steps THEN coconut trained for 1000 more steps'. This is a sequential comparison, not a controlled experiment.",
      "location": "Statistical analysis section 3.1, coconut_warmstart condition definition",
      "recommendation": "REQUIRED: Add a condition 'coconut_from_scratch' (n=5 minimum) trained for 2000 steps total with COCONUT from initialization. This is the only valid comparison to baseline_2000. The warm-start comparison answers a DIFFERENT question: 'Can we improve an already-trained baseline by adding COCONUT?' which is valuable but distinct from 'Does COCONUT architecture outperform baseline architecture?'",

This means conclusions about FLOP confound and regularization have 44% less power than the main effect.",
      "location": "Section 1: Descriptive Statistics",
      "recommendation": "For publication-ready results: Run additional seeds to bring ALL conditions to n=10. Priority order: (1) baseline_6000 (FLOP control), (2) baseline_2000_dropout (regularization control), (3) baseline_2000.

These are NOT equivalent computationally because: (a) COCONUT's 5 passes are serial within a single batch, not 5 independent batches, (b) gradient updates happen at different frequencies (every step vs every 5 passes), (c) learning rate schedules differ.",

The fact that baseline_6000 overfits doesn't prove COCONUT is better—it proves that naively extending baseline training duration is harmful. To properly control for compute: (1) Report wall-clock time per condition, (2) Compare baseline_1000 to coconut_warmstart at matched wall-clock time, OR (3) Run baseline_adaptive that uses early stopping at its best checkpoint (already partially addressed with 'best-ever' analysis in 3.3).",

These samples are not independent; they share common history. The appropriate comparison is either: (a) paired t-test (treating each seed as a pair: baseline_1000 vs coconut_warmstart from same seed), OR (b) repeated measures ANOVA acknowledging within-seed correlation.",
      "location": "Section 2: Pairwise t-tests, line 32",

The conclusion 'not regularization' is premature. Additionally, comparing baseline_2000_dropout (2000 steps, dropout=0.2) to baseline_1000 (1000 steps, dropout=0.1) confounds dropout with training duration.",

These extremely large effects suggest either: (a) highly deterministic phenomenon with minimal noise, (b) measurement with very low variance, or (c) potential data quality issue. No discussion of whether these effect sizes are plausible given the domain.",

This indicates highly reproducible effects across random seeds, consistent with deterministic architecture differences rather than stochastic training noise.'

This inflates the chance of finding spurious differences.",
      "location": "Section 3.3: Best-Ever Comparison",
      "recommendation": "Label this analysis as 'exploratory post-hoc analysis' in the manuscript. Do not use it as primary evidence.

However, this is not documented in the methods.",

These stage transitions are not explained and may represent changes in the COCONUT mechanism itself (e.g., increasing numbers of reasoning passes). If stages change the computational cost or reasoning depth, then the comparison to baseline is confounded.",

If different seeds have different numbers of stages, this is a major confound. Verify: (1) All coconut seeds have same stage structure, (2) Stages are deterministic (not adaptive to training dynamics), (3) Total forward passes accounting includes all stage-specific overhead.

  "summary": "The experiment demonstrates compelling evidence for COCONUT's effectiveness, but has several critical methodological issues that must be addressed before publication. Most serious: (1) warm-start design conflates sequential improvement with architectural superiority, (2) sample size imbalance reduces power for critical controls, (3) regularization control is confounded, (4) paired statistical tests required due to shared seeds, (5) COCONUT 'stages' are undocumented. The baseline_6000 overfitting result is valuable but doesn't validate FLOP-matching claim due to optimizer step vs forward pass confusion. Recommend: add coconut_from_scratch condition, balance sample sizes, fix regularization control, re-run as paired tests, document COCONUT stages, and temper claims about synergy given incomplete factorial design."
