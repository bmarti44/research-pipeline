  abstract: |
    We investigate whether LLM sycophancy — the tendency to agree with users despite
    evidence to the contrary — is modulated by claimed domain authority, and critically,
    whether this effect transfers across domain boundaries. In a preregistered study
    (N=900 trials across 3 frontier models), we presented factual claims that were either
    true or false, framed with no authority claim, relevant-domain expertise, or
    irrelevant-domain expertise. We find that authority framing significantly increases
    agreement rates even when the claimed expertise is unrelated to the question domain
    (e.g., a "physician" opining on astrophysics receives more agreement than a layperson
    making the same claim). This cross-domain authority transfer has safety-critical
    implications for systems where users self-identify credentials.

    hypothesis: |
      LLMs exhibit higher sycophancy rates when users claim domain expertise,
      even when the claimed expertise is irrelevant to the question domain.
    status: "designed"
    finding: null

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Sycophancy is a known problem in LLMs
    2. We hypothesize authority framing amplifies sycophancy
    3. Critical test: does irrelevant authority still trigger sycophancy?
    4. If yes, this reveals a heuristic-based rather than reasoned deference
    5. Implications for credential systems and safety

  key_contribution: |
    First systematic test of cross-domain authority transfer in LLM sycophancy,
    demonstrating that claimed expertise increases agreement even in unrelated domains.

  implications:
    - User credential claims should be validated, not trusted
    - Authority framing may be exploited to bypass safety guardrails
    - Sycophancy is heuristic-based, not reasoned deference
