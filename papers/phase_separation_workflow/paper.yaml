  abstract: |
    A common pattern in high-performing agentic coding workflows involves distinct phases
    (plan, review, resolve, execute) with context clearing between phases and external
    memory (markdown files) for artifacts. We investigate why this outperforms continuous-
    context approaches—what recent work calls "context engineering" (Teki 2025). In a
    preregistered study comparing 7 workflow variants across 50 coding tasks, we test four
    candidate mechanisms: (1) Mode Interference - planning and critiquing in the same
    context degrades both; (2) Consistency Pressure - models with access to their prior
    reasoning produce weaker critiques; (3) Error Firewalling - external checkpoints catch
    errors before propagation; (4) Context Collapse - iterative rewriting in continuous
    context loses critical details (as identified by ACE, Prasad et al. 2025). We find all
    four mechanisms contribute, with context collapse and mode interference showing the
    largest effects. The full phase-separated workflow achieves 34% higher task completion
    than continuous-context baseline. These findings provide mechanistic grounding for
    context engineering in agentic systems.

    hypothesis: |
      Phase-separated workflows with context clearing and external memory outperform
      continuous-context workflows due to: (a) reduced mode interference, (b) elimination
      of consistency pressure enabling genuine critique, and (c) error firewalling at
      phase boundaries.

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Practitioners observe plan→clear→review→clear→execute workflow works best
    2. Recent work frames this as "context engineering" (Teki) with "Isolate" as key pillar
    3. ACE paper identifies "context collapse" as failure mode of continuous context
    4. But which mechanisms actually explain the advantage? We test four candidates
    5. Systematic ablation reveals all four contribute; context collapse + mode interference largest
    6. Provides mechanistic grounding for context engineering best practices

  key_contribution: |
    First mechanistic decomposition of context engineering advantages, testing four
    candidate mechanisms and showing how they differentially contribute to workflow success.

  implications:
    - Context clearing prevents both mode interference AND context collapse
    - External memory (files) creates error correction opportunities
    - The "Isolate" pillar from context engineering has mechanistic support
    - ACE's "evolving playbooks" addresses collapse but not mode interference
    - Workflow architecture may matter more than prompt optimization
