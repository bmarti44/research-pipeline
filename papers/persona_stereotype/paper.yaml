  abstract: |
    We investigate whether persona-induced reasoning degradation in LLMs is caused by
    stereotype activation or cognitive load from additional prompt text. In a preregistered
    study using 8 demographic personas × 5 persona conditions × 200 reasoning questions,
    we find that degradation is primarily mediated by stereotype activation: personas with
    counter-stereotypical expertise (e.g., "elderly mathematician") show significantly
    less degradation than demographic-only personas, while nonsense control text of equal
    length shows no degradation. This supports the stereotype activation mechanism over
    cognitive load, with direct implications for persona-based chatbot design: always pair
    demographic personas with capability descriptors.

    title: "Stereotype vs Cognitive Load in Persona Degradation"
    hypothesis: |
      Persona-induced reasoning degradation is eliminated when demographic
      personas include counter-stereotypical expertise, supporting stereotype
      activation over cognitive load as the mechanism.
    status: "designed"
    finding: null

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Persona prompting is common in chatbots and simulations
    2. Prior work shows up to 70% reasoning degradation with some personas
    3. Two competing explanations: cognitive load vs stereotype activation
    4. We use counter-stereotypical expertise to disentangle mechanisms
    5. Find stereotype activation is primary driver; fix is to pair with capability descriptors

  key_contribution: |
    Mechanistic evidence that persona degradation is caused by stereotype activation,
    not cognitive load, with a practical fix (capability descriptors).

  implications:
    - Always pair demographic personas with expertise/capability descriptions
    - "Elderly mathematician" better than "elderly person" for reasoning tasks
    - Cognitive load from prompt text is not the issue
