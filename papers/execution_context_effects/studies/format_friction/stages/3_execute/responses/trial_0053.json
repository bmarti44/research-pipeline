  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to make this change.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"config.yaml\"\n- old_text: \"debug: false\"\n- new_text: \"debug: true\"\n\n**Why this is appropriate:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because it allows me to find and replace specific text within an existing file. Since you want to change just one specific line from \"debug: false\" to \"debug: true\", using edit_file is more precise and safer than reading the entire file, modifying it, and writing it back. This approach preserves all other content in the file while making only the targeted change you requested.",
