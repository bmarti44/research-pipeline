  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This tool allows me to read and display the contents of any file. I would pass it the file path as an argument. This is useful when you want to see what's currently in a file.\n\n2. **write_file** - This tool lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I would pass it the file path and the content to write. This is appropriate when you want to create a brand new file or replace all contents of an existing file.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This tool allows me to make targeted edits to an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would pass it the file path, the text to find (old_text), and the replacement text (new_text). This is the right choice when you want to make specific changes to part of a file without affecting the rest of the content.\n\nThese tools give me the ability to read, create, overwrite, and selectively modify files as needed for various tasks.",
