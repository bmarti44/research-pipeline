  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n**Why this is appropriate:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to make a targeted change to an existing file - specifically replacing the version number while leaving everything else in the package.json file unchanged. This is more precise than reading the entire file, modifying it, and writing it back, as it directly targets the specific text that needs to be updated.",
