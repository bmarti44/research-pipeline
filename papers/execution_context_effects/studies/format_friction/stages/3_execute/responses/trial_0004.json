  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This allows me to read and view the contents of any file by providing the file path. It's useful when you want to see what's currently in a file.\n\n2. **write_file** - This lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I need to provide the file path and the complete content to write.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This allows me to make targeted edits to an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I need to provide the file path, the text to find, and the replacement text.\n\nThese tools give me the ability to read, create, overwrite, and selectively modify files on the system. They're particularly useful for tasks like reviewing code, creating new documents, updating configuration files, or making specific changes to existing content.",
