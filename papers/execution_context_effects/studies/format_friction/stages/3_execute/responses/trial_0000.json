  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This allows me to read and display the contents of any file by providing the file path. I would use this when you want to see what's currently in a file.\n\n2. **write_file** - This lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I would use this when you want to create a brand new file or replace all contents of an existing file. It takes a file path and the content to write.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This allows me to make targeted edits to existing files by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would use this when you want to modify just a portion of an existing file rather than rewriting the whole thing. It requires the file path, the text to find, and the replacement text.\n\nThese tools allow me to help you with various file operations like viewing file contents, creating new files, and making precise edits to existing files.",
