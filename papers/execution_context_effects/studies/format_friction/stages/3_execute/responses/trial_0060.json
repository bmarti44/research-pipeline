  "response": "I'll help you update the version in package.json from '1.0.0' to '1.1.0'. Here's what I would do:\n\nFirst, I would use the **read_file** tool to examine the current contents of package.json. I'd pass the argument:\n- path: \"package.json\"\n\nThis is necessary to see the current structure and confirm the version field that needs to be updated.\n\nThen, I would use the **edit_file** tool to make the version change. I'd pass these arguments:\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\nThe edit_file tool is the most appropriate choice here because it allows me to make a precise replacement of just the version number without affecting the rest of the package.json file structure. This is safer than rewriting the entire file and ensures that formatting, comments, and other fields remain unchanged.",
