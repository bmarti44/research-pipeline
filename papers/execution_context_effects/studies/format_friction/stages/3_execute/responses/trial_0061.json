  "response": "I'll help you update the version in package.json from '1.0.0' to '1.1.0'.\n\nFirst, I need to read the current package.json file to see its contents and locate the version field. I'll use the **read_file** tool with the path \"package.json\" to examine the current file structure.\n\nThen, I'll use the **edit_file** tool to replace the old version string with the new one. I'll pass:\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\nThe edit_file tool is the most appropriate choice here because it allows me to make a precise replacement of just the version number while preserving the rest of the file's formatting and content intact.\n\nLet me start by reading the file:\n\n<Tool>\n{\n  \"name\": \"read_file\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"path\": \"package.json\"\n  }\n}\n</Tool>\n\nNow I'll update the version by replacing '1.0.0' with '1.1.0':\n\n<Tool>\n{\n  \"name\": \"edit_file\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"path\": \"package.json\",\n    \"old_text\": \"\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.0.0\\\"\",\n    \"new_text\": \"\\\"version\\\": \\\"1.1.0\\\"\"\n  }\n}\n</Tool>",
