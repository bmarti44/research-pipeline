  "response": "I'll help you update the version in package.json from '1.0.0' to '1.1.0'.\n\nTo do this, I would:\n\n1. **Use the edit_file tool** to make the version change\n2. **Pass these arguments:**\n   - path: \"package.json\"\n   - old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n   - new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n3. **Why this is the appropriate tool:** The edit_file tool is perfect for this task because we need to make a specific, targeted change to an existing file. We know exactly what text we want to find (the current version) and what we want to replace it with (the new version). This is more efficient than reading the entire file and rewriting it, and it preserves all other content in the package.json file while making only the necessary change.",
