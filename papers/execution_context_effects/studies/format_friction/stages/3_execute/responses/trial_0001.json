  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This tool allows me to read and view the contents of any file by specifying its path. I would use this when you want to see what's inside a file or when I need to examine existing content before making changes.\n\n2. **write_file** - This tool lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I would use this when you want to create a brand new file or when you want to replace all the content in an existing file with something entirely different.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This tool allows me to make targeted changes to an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would use this when you want to modify just a portion of a file rather than rewriting the entire thing - for example, updating a specific line, fixing a typo, or replacing a particular section.\n\nThese tools give me the ability to help you read, create, and modify files on your system. Just let me know what you'd like to do with any files!",
