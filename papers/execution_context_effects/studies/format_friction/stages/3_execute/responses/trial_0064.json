  "response": "I'll help you update the version in package.json from '1.0.0' to '1.1.0'.\n\nFirst, I would use the **read_file** tool to examine the current contents of package.json. I would pass the argument `path: \"package.json\"` to see the existing file structure and confirm the current version.\n\nThen, I would use the **edit_file** tool to make the version change. I would pass these arguments:\n- `path: \"package.json\"`\n- `old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'`\n- `new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'`\n\nThe edit_file tool is the most appropriate choice here because it allows me to make a precise replacement of just the version number without affecting the rest of the package.json file structure. This is safer than rewriting the entire file and preserves all existing formatting and content.",
