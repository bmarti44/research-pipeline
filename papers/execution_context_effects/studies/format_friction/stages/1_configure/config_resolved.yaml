research_questions:
- id: rq1
  question: Does JSON format cause serialization failures that wouldn't occur with
    NL?
- id: rq2
  question: What is the rate of true format friction (correct intent, incorrect output)?
study:
  hypothesis: 'LLMs exhibit higher error rates when producing structured JSON tool
    calls

    compared to expressing the same intent in natural language.


    STATUS: PILOT REFUTED THIS HYPOTHESIS

    - JSON syntax validity: 100%

    - JSON schema correctness: 98.5%

    - True serialization failures: 1.5%


    The "friction" observed was actually behavioral adaptation, not serialization
    failure.
