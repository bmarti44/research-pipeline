  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Tool:** edit_file\n**Arguments:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n**Why this is appropriate:** The edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to make a specific, targeted change to an existing file. I'm replacing just the version number while keeping the rest of the package.json file intact. This is more efficient and safer than reading the entire file, modifying it, and writing it back, as it minimizes the risk of accidentally changing other parts of the file.",
