  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n**Why this is the appropriate tool:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to find a specific piece of text (the current version \"1.0.0\") and replace it with the new version (\"1.1.0\"). This is a targeted change that doesn't require rewriting the entire file - just updating one specific value. The edit_file tool will locate the exact text match and replace only that portion, preserving all other content in the package.json file.",
