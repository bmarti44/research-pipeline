  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n**Why this is appropriate:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to make a specific, targeted change to an existing file - replacing one version number with another. This tool allows me to find the exact text `\"version\": \"1.0.0\"` and replace it with `\"version\": \"1.1.0\"` without affecting any other part of the package.json file. It's more precise than rewriting the entire file and more efficient than reading the file first to examine its contents.",
