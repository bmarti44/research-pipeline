The write_file tool is perfect for this task as it can create a new file (or overwrite an existing one) with the exact Python code needed. The script will contain a simple print statement that outputs 'test' when executed.\n\n<write_file>\n<path>/tmp/test.py</path>\n<content>print('test')\n</content>\n</write_file>",
