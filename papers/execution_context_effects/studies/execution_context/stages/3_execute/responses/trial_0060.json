  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: \"1.0.0\"\n- new_text: \"1.1.0\"\n\n**Why this is the appropriate tool:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to make a specific, targeted change to an existing file. I'm replacing one specific piece of text (the version number \"1.0.0\") with another (\"1.1.0\") without affecting the rest of the file structure. This is more efficient than reading the entire file, modifying it, and writing it back, and it's safer than overwriting the whole file since it only changes the exact text I specify.",
