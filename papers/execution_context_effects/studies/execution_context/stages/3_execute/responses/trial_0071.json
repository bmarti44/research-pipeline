  "response": "I'll help you fix the typo in main.py by changing 'pritn' to 'print'. Let me first read the file to see its current contents, then make the correction.\n\nFirst, I would use the **read_file** tool with the argument `path: \"main.py\"` to examine the current contents of the file and locate the typo.\n\nThen, I would use the **edit_file** tool with the arguments:\n- `path: \"main.py\"`\n- `old_text: \"pritn\"`\n- `new_text: \"print\"`\n\nThis is the appropriate approach because the edit_file tool is specifically designed for making targeted text replacements in existing files, which is exactly what we need to fix this typo. It's more efficient than reading the entire file and rewriting it, especially if the file contains other content that should remain unchanged.",
