  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This allows me to read and view the contents of any file by providing the file path. I would use this when you want to see what's currently in a file.\n\n2. **write_file** - This lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I would use this when you want to create a brand new file or replace all the contents of an existing file with something entirely different.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This allows me to make targeted changes to an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would use this when you want to modify just a portion of a file rather than rewriting the whole thing.\n\nThese tools give me the ability to help you read, create, and modify files on your system. Is there a particular file operation you'd like me to help you with?",
