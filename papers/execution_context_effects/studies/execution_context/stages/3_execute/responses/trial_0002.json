  "response": "I have access to three file management tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This allows me to read and view the contents of any file by specifying its path. I would use this when you want to see what's inside a file or when I need to examine existing content before making changes.\n\n2. **write_file** - This lets me create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. I would use this when you want to create a brand new file or replace all contents of an existing file with something entirely different.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This allows me to make targeted changes to an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would use this when you want to modify just a portion of a file without changing the rest of the content.\n\nThese tools cover the basic file operations of reading, writing, and editing files on your system. Is there a specific file operation you'd like me to help you with?",
