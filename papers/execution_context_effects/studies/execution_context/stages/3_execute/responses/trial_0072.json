  "response": "I'll help you fix the typo in main.py. Let me first read the file to see the current content and locate the typo.\n\nI would use the **read_file** tool with the argument `path: \"main.py\"` to examine the contents of the file and find where the typo \"pritn\" appears.\n\nAfter reading the file, I would then use the **edit_file** tool with:\n- `path: \"main.py\"`\n- `old_text: \"pritn\"` \n- `new_text: \"print\"`\n\nThis is the appropriate approach because the edit_file tool is specifically designed for making targeted text replacements in existing files, which is perfect for fixing a simple typo like this. It will find the misspelled \"pritn\" and replace it with the correct \"print\" spelling.",
