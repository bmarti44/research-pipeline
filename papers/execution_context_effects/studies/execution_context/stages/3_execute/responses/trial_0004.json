  "response": "I have access to three file manipulation tools:\n\n1. **read_file** - This tool allows me to read the contents of a file. I would use this when you want to see what's inside a specific file. I need to provide the path to the file as an argument.\n\n2. **write_file** - This tool lets me write content to a file, either creating a new file or completely overwriting an existing one. I would use this when you want to create a new file with specific content or replace all the content in an existing file. I need to provide both the file path and the content to write.\n\n3. **edit_file** - This tool allows me to edit an existing file by finding specific text and replacing it with new text. I would use this when you want to make targeted changes to a file without rewriting the entire thing. I need to provide the file path, the text to find (old_text), and the text to replace it with (new_text).\n\nThese tools give me the ability to help you read, create, modify, and update files on your system.",
