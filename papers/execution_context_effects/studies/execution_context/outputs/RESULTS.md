# execution_context: Results

## Hypothesis

When LLM output will actually execute (JSON tool calls), the model adopts
safer behaviors for destructive operations. This is operation-specific
caution, not serialization failure.

PILOT OBSERVATION:
- edit_file tasks: 100% chose "read first" in JSON mode
- create_file tasks: 0% cautious behavior
- This is execution-aware alignment activation, not format friction
