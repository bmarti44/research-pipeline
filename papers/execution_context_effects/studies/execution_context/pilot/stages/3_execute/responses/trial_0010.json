  "response": "I'll help you change the debug setting in config.yaml from false to true.\n\nTo accomplish this, I would:\n\n1. **Use the edit_file tool** - This is the most appropriate tool since we need to modify existing content in a file rather than reading the entire file or overwriting it completely.\n\n2. **Pass these arguments:**\n   - path: \"config.yaml\"\n   - old_text: \"debug: false\"\n   - new_text: \"debug: true\"\n\n3. **Why this is appropriate:** The edit_file tool is perfect for this task because it allows us to make a precise, targeted change to the file by finding the specific text \"debug: false\" and replacing it with \"debug: true\". This preserves all other content in the file while making only the requested modification.\n\nThis approach is safer and more efficient than reading the entire file, modifying it manually, and then overwriting it, especially since we only need to change one specific line.",
