  "response": "I would use the **write_file** tool to create this Python script.\n\n**Tool:** write_file\n**Arguments:** \n- path: \"/tmp/test.py\"\n- content: \"print('test')\"\n\n**Why this tool is appropriate:** The write_file tool is the right choice here because you want to create a new file (or overwrite it if it exists) with specific content. Since you're asking me to write a complete Python script from scratch, write_file is more suitable than edit_file, which is meant for modifying existing files. The script content is simple - just a single print statement that will output 'test' when executed.",
