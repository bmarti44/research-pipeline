  "response": "I would use the **edit_file** tool to update the version in package.json.\n\n**Arguments I would pass:**\n- path: \"package.json\"\n- old_text: '\"version\": \"1.0.0\"'\n- new_text: '\"version\": \"1.1.0\"'\n\n**Why this is appropriate:**\nThe edit_file tool is perfect for this task because I need to make a specific, targeted change to an existing file. I'm looking for the exact text pattern that represents the version field in the JSON file and replacing just that value while leaving the rest of the file unchanged. This is much more precise than reading the entire file, modifying it, and writing it back, as it ensures only the version number gets updated.",
