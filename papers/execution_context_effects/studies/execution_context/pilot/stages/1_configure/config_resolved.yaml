research_questions:
- id: rq1
  question: Does JSON mode increase 'read before edit' behavior for destructive operations?
- id: rq2
  question: Is this effect operation-specific (edit vs create vs read)?
- id: rq3
  question: Does this represent alignment activation or capability limitation?
study:
  hypothesis: 'When LLM output will actually execute (JSON tool calls), the model
    adopts

    safer behaviors for destructive operations. This is operation-specific

    caution, not serialization failure.


    PILOT OBSERVATION:

    - edit_file tasks: 100% chose "read first" in JSON mode

    - create_file tasks: 0% cautious behavior

    - This is execution-aware alignment activation, not format friction
