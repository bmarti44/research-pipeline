  abstract: |
    We investigate how LLM tool selection accuracy scales with the number of
    available tools. In a preregistered study varying tool count from 5 to 50,
    we find that accuracy exhibits a phase transition rather than gradual
    degradation: performance remains stable up to a model-specific threshold
    (~15-20 tools), then drops sharply (>20% loss within +5 tools). Furthermore,
    semantically similar distractor tools cause disproportionately more degradation
    than unrelated tools. These findings have direct implications for MCP server
    design and agent framework architecture, suggesting dynamic tool filtering
    rather than static large tool sets.

    title: "Phase Transitions in Tool Selection Accuracy"
    hypothesis: |
      Tool selection accuracy remains stable up to ~15-20 tools, then drops
      sharply. Semantically similar distractors cause more degradation than
      unrelated tools.
    status: "designed"
    finding: null

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Agents need many tools, but tool count affects accuracy
    2. We test whether degradation is gradual or sharp (phase transition)
    3. Find a cliff rather than a slope around 15-20 tools
    4. Semantically similar tools are particularly problematic
    5. Implications: dynamic tool filtering is essential

  key_contribution: |
    First systematic demonstration of phase transitions in tool selection,
    providing concrete guidance for maximum tool counts in production systems.

  implications:
    - Keep tool sets under ~15 tools or use dynamic filtering
    - Avoid semantically similar tool names/descriptions
    - Consider tool clustering and retrieval strategies
