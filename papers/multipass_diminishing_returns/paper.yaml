  abstract: |
    Multi-pass LLM code review shows a consistent pattern: ~5 passes catches most errors,
    with diminishing returns thereafter. We investigate the mechanism underlying this
    phenomenon. In a preregistered study with 500 code samples containing seeded errors
    of 7 types, we track detection rates across 1-10 review passes. We find evidence for
    error stratification over geometric decay: different error types exhibit distinct
    detection probability curves. Syntax errors reach 95% detection by pass 2, logic
    errors reach 80% by pass 5, while subtle bugs (race conditions, edge cases) plateau
    at ~40% regardless of pass count. The "5-pass rule" emerges from the weighted average
    of these stratified curves - it's the point where high and moderate detectability
    errors saturate, leaving only low-detectability errors. This has implications for
    code review workflows: additional passes are only valuable if they use different
    review strategies targeting the remaining error types.

    hypothesis: |
      The diminishing returns of multi-pass code review reflects error stratification:
      distinct error types have different per-pass detection probabilities, and the
      5-pass "knee" emerges from the aggregate of these stratified curves.

narrative:
  story_arc: |
    1. Practitioners observe "5 passes catches most errors" rule of thumb
    2. Two competing explanations: geometric decay vs error stratification
    3. We seed known errors of different types and track detection by pass
    4. Find stratification - different error types have different detection curves
    5. The 5-pass knee is an emergent property of aggregating stratified curves
    6. Implications: after 5 passes, switch strategy rather than repeat

  key_contribution: |
    First mechanistic explanation of the multi-pass diminishing returns phenomenon,
    showing it emerges from error type stratification rather than simple geometric decay.

  implications:
    - Passes 1-2 should focus on syntax/type errors (high detectability)
    - Passes 3-5 should target logic errors (moderate detectability)
    - After pass 5, switch to different review strategy (fuzzing, formal verification)
    - Don't waste compute on passes 6+ with same prompt
