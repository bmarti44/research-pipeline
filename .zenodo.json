  "title": "Format Friction: The Compliance Gap in Prompt-Based Tool Calling",
  "description": "This repository contains the paper, code, and data for research on format friction in LLM tool-calling systems. We find a 10.3pp gap between signal detection and XML compliance in structured output conditions, with friction concentrating in ambiguous scenarios (0pp explicit vs 18.4pp implicit). Two-pass recovery mechanisms can recover 50-74% of compliance gaps.",
